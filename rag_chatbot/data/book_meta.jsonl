{"text": "Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin is an introduc- tion to mineralogy for undergraduate and graduate students in the \ufb01elds of geology, materials science, and environmental science. It has been designed as a textbook for use on a semester course and covers all aspects of mineralogy in a thoroughly modern and integrated way. The book is divided into \ufb01ve parts. Part I deals with the general concepts of structures and bond- ing within minerals, and introduces symmetry prin- ciples as well as graphic representations such as the stereographic projection. It discusses growth, de- fects, and general issues of isomorphism and poly- morphism. Part II centers on the physics of miner- als, including determination of structural features by X-ray diffraction, an introduction to optical prop- erties, and the use of the petrographic microscope. Part III explores the range of naturally forming minerals and introduces hand specimen identi\ufb01- cation. It gives an overview of the various modes of mineral formation, and provides a background in thermodynamics to facilitate an understanding of mineral equilibria in geological environments and phase transformations. Part IV provides a sys- tematic treatment of mineral groups within the context of mineral-forming environments. Part V demonstrates the application of mineralogy to the \ufb01elds of metal deposits, gems, cement, and hu- man health. It also explores how minerals form in the universe, and how they have been active components at each stage of the evolution of the earth. Throughout the text, emphasis is placed on link- ing minerals to broader geological processes. Unlike more traditional books on this topic, the authors also convey the importance of minerals within our everyday lives and their economic value. Complete with beautiful color photographs, handy reference tables and a glossary of terms, this textbook will be an indispensable guide for the next generation of mineralogy students. Hans-Rudolf Wenk is Professor of Geology at the Uni- versity of California at Berkeley and Andrei Bulakh is Professor in the Department of Mineralogy at St Pe- tersburg State University. Both have written many research papers in the \ufb01elds of mineralogy, crys- tallography, geochemistry and tectonophysics, and have used this extensive expertise to create a com- prehensive and stimulating textbook.", "page": 2}

{"text": "Preface Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin is an intro- duction to mineralogy for undergraduate stu- dents and graduate students in all \ufb01elds of geology, materials science, and environmental sciences, and for those with a general interest in the subject. As a background, the reader is as- sumed to be familiar with general principles of physics and chemistry at the high school level. In this text we introduce principles of crystallo- graphic and structural features of minerals, as well as the physical property characteristics used to identify them. We also provide a survey of the most important minerals (about 250 and details for about 100) and their geological occurrence. The basic types of mineral deposit, both those of scienti\ufb01c and those of economic importance, are discussed, often in conjunction with the system- atic treatment of the mineral classes most closely associated with particular deposits. The book con- cludes with a series of chapters on applied min- eralogy, including a survey of the main industrial uses of minerals. There are many excellent mineralogy text- books, ranging from the early Niggli (1920) mono- graph (which still contains much of the infor- mation which is needed), to modern books such as Putnis (1992), Blackburn and Dennen (1994), Perkins (1998), Nesse (2000), Hibbard (2002) and Klein (2002). Why do we add a new book to an already seemingly saturated market? To answer this question, we need to look at how mineralogy courses have evolved. The modern earth science curriculum, particularly at American universities, is very different from that taught 25 years ago. At that time mineral- ogy was covered with two- to four-semester-long courses. Today mineralogy has become at best a one-semester course with two lectures per week and laboratory sessions. This change in empha- sis is due to evolving \ufb01elds such as geomorphol- ogy, hydrology, climatology, and geophysics that increasingly have become part of the standard earth science course load. Yet the importance of mineralogy for a wide variety of disciplines has increased. Fields ranging from igneous petrology to soils science, from archaeology to cement en- gineering, from materials science to structural geology make use of mineralogy, and students from these diverse disciplines need to be accom- modated. Students do not have time to go into great detail but they do need to become aware of basic concepts. Our book provides an alterna- tive to existing texts by focusing more tightly on concepts, at the expense of completeness, and by integrating geological processes and applications more closely with the discussions of systematic mineralogy. Our goal is to be selective in including mate- rial rather than all inclusive, yet trying to remain quantitative, scienti\ufb01cally sound, and avoiding super\ufb01ciality. It is well known that many stu- dents are frightened of mathematical expres- sions. We are using a few equations here and there, but they can be skipped, without losing the thread, if students do not have the necessary background. Since most geology programs re- quire mathematics and physics courses, it seems only reasonable to show students", "page": 16}
{"text": "that some of this is useful and can be applied to earth sci- ences. It brings satisfaction to those who have taken mathematics courses to see some quantita- tive relationships, for example how trigonometry can be used to calculate interfacial angles, basic thermodynamics to understand a boundary in a phase diagram, simple linear algebra to appreci- ate why a second-rank tensor, such as the opti- cal indicatrix, has the shape of an ellipsoid, or how complex numbers can be used to add waves more easily analytically than graphically to ob- tain diffraction intensities. One of the biggest challenges in teaching mineralogy is that some of the most dif\ufb01cult, theoretically demanding material, is presented relatively early in the course. There are logical reasons for focusing on crystal chemistry and crystallographic topics earlier, rather than later. Many students have already encountered some of this background in earlier courses in chem- istry and physics and there is a natural connec- tion to these concepts of mineralogy. However, we", "page": 16}
{"text": "xvi PREFACE do recognize that crystallography is a notoriously dif\ufb01cult challenge for many students, requiring them to become adept at three-dimensional visu- alization, which is often initially dif\ufb01cult. Thus our treatment of this subject judiciously empha- sizes the most important concepts so that stu- dents are not left to wade through pages of ex- haustive facts that in many cases are better left for later courses. The presentation of the text deviates some- what from the conventional organizational ap- proach that separates geometry (crystallography), crystal chemistry, systematic mineralogy, and petrology. Instead, throughout the book we com- bine theoretical subjects with experiments, and discuss larger mineral-forming processes in the context of speci\ufb01c mineral groups (e.g., the ori- gin of granite with feldspars). Such an approach comes naturally and is more likely to focus stu- dent interest in the subject. The goal has been to select material that should make it easier to teach mineralogy and make learning about min- erals more stimulating. As mentioned above, our goal is to empha- size concepts and to minimize nomenclature. In order not to interrupt the \ufb02ow of required material, some case studies and details are in- cluded in \u2018\u2018technical boxes\u2019\u2019, while \u2018\u2018enrichment boxes\u2019\u2019 contain supplementary historical mate- rial or applications. The text includes appendices covering identi\ufb01cation of hand specimens and optical properties. Some subjects are necessary background for all aspects of mineralogy: basic rules of crystal chemistry (Chapter 2), lattice, and symmetry (Chapters 3 and 4). Many other chapters are optional and can be skipped at the discretion of the instructor. The book is divided into \ufb01ve parts. Part I deals with general concepts of structures, bonding, in- troduces the lattice concept, symmetry and crys- tal forms as well as geometrical representations such as stereographic projection. It also discusses growth, defects and general issues of isomor- phism and polymorphism. Part II centers on the physics of minerals. First it shows how to determine by X-ray diffraction the structural features introduced in Part I. Chap- ter 8 on physical properties is optional but we in- clude it because of the importance of this \ufb01eld for modern geophysics. We introduce optical proper- ties and the use of the petrographic microscope early on because most mineralogy courses need to have this background before mineral systems are discussed in detail. Clearly parts of Chapter 10 on mineral identi\ufb01cation with a microscope rely on access to relevant laboratory equipment. If there is no such access to microscopes, or if a separate course in optical mineralogy is available, Chapters 9 and 10 can be skipped. Chapter 12, on advanced analytical techniques, introduces equipment that may be encountered in modern mineralogical research laboratories and provides references for further study. Part III explores the range of minerals and introduces hand specimen identi\ufb01cation. It also discusses the wide range of mineral forma- tion, and provides some background in thermo- dynamics for understanding mineral equilibria in geological environments and phase transfor- mations. Later chapters include applications of thermodynamics to sedimentary, hydrothermal, metamorphic, and igneous", "page": 17}
{"text": "processes to demon- strate its relevancy. Part IV is a systematic treatment of mineral groups and about 200 of the most important min- erals. Each chapter combines mineral character- istics with a discussion of a mineral-forming en- vironment. Part V on applied mineralogy deals with top- ics such as metal deposits, gems, cement, hu- man health, and explores how minerals form in the universe and were active components at each stage of the evolution of the earth. This part is largely independent of the rest of the book. If there is no time in class, these chapters can be used as reading assignments and form good start- ing points for term projects. The chapters should illustrate to students that mineralogy is not just complicated formulas, strange names, Miller in- dices, and point-groups, but has some practical signi\ufb01cance. This may raise some interest. Appendices contain determinative tables and important technical terms are de\ufb01ned in a glos- sary. The book is written in a modular fashion that permits instructors to select or omit some parts, depending on the level of the course, without compromising the continuity.", "page": 17}
{"text": "PREFACE xvii r The content of the whole book seems to us the minimum one would expect a mineralogy graduate student to know before entering a qualifying examination. In that sense it can be used as a review. Reference is made to more detailed work to pursue in-depth studies. r A descriptive one-semester course may omit most of Part II, except perhaps Chapter 11 (Color), Chapters 17--18 (Thermodynamics, and Solid Solutions), as well as most of the advanced boxes. A selection of chapters from Part V can be useful. r A more analytical one-semester mineralogy course at major universities would probably touch only brie\ufb02y on Chapter 8 (Physical properties), may omit Chapters 9 and 10 (if no microscope laboratory session is associated with the course), Chapter 12 (Additional analytical methods), and may not have time to include much of Part V, except for reading assignments. The origin of this book goes back to 1993, when a student from (then) Leningrad visited Berkeley on an exchange program and brought a little red book on mineralogy, written by her pro- fessor, Andrei Bulakh, that caught Rudy Wenk\u2019s attention because it was exactly the kind of brief introduction into mineralogy he was looking for. Over the following years we established further contact, in part through the exchange of another student, Anton Chakmouradyan, who came to play a considerable role in this project. After re- ciprocal visits to St Petersburg and Berkeley, spon- sored by the University of California Education Abroad Program, the authors decided to attempt to produce an English mineralogy book, in the spirit of the Russian version, though not a trans- lation. The different backgrounds of the authors guarantee a broad view: Andrei Bulakh is a spe- cialist on alkaline rocks and minerals and geo- chemistry and has written several books that are widely used in Russian universities. Rudy Wenk\u2019s research has emphasized metamorphic rocks, in- cluding deformation, and investigations of mi- crostructures in feldspars and carbonates. Both have taught introductory mineralogy at major universities for a long time. In this book we have tried to unite our expertise. H.-R. Wenk A. Bulakh", "page": 18}

{"text": "Chapter 1 Subject and history of mineralogy What is mineralogy? The answer to the question posed above may seem obvious: mineralogy is the study of min- erals. From introductory geology classes you may know that all rocks and ores consist of miner- als. For instance, quartz, biotite, and feldspar are the main minerals of granites; and hematite and magnetite are the major minerals of iron ores. At one point mineralogy was well de\ufb01ned as dealing with those naturally occurring elementary build- ing blocks of the earth that are chemically and structurally homogeneous. This simple de\ufb01nition of a mineral has changed over time. As the de\ufb01- nition of \u2018\u2018mineral\u201d has become more vague, the boundaries of \u2018\u2018mineralogy\u201d have opened and in- creasingly overlap other sciences. In this book we take a broad view of mineral- ogy. Minerals are naturally occurring, macroscop- ically homogeneous chemical compounds with a regular crystal structure. Traditionally also in- cluded are homogeneous compounds that do not have a regular structure such as opal (a colloidal solid), natural liquid mercury, and amorphous mineral products formed by radioactive decay. (Such products are known as metamict minerals.) Rocks, ores, and mineral deposits, which are stud- ied in petrology and geochemistry, will also be discussed in order to emphasize the geological processes that are of central interest to all who study earth materials. Other materials are more peripheral but nev- ertheless have similar properties and obey the same laws as the minerals mentioned above. For example ice, a mineral according to our de\ufb01nition, is mainly the object of glaciology and soils science. Apatite (a major constituent of bones and teeth), carbonates (which form the skeletons of mollusks), and oxalates and urates (of which human kidney stones are composed) are studied in medicine and in a speci\ufb01c branch of mineralogy called \u2018\u2018biomineralogy\u201d. Crystals growing in concrete, known as cement miner- als, are not natural products but they are of enormous economic importance. Other arti\ufb01cial compounds with a crystal structure occur as a result of industrial transformations in natural conditions. They may form because of chemi- cal alteration of buried waste products or by means of interaction between the soils and con- taminated groundwater. Modern environmental geology, hydrology, and soils science are con- cerned with these mineral-like materials and study them with methods similar to those em- ployed in mineralogy. Mineralogy is broadening its scope and now overlaps other disciplines in a way that was not envisioned a few years ago. For example, newly discovered high-temperature superconduc- tors have a structure related to the mineral per- ovskite and often possess a morphology resem- bling clays. We will include a discussion of some of the new subjects of mineralogy in this text, but our focus is on those natural, chemically and structurally homogeneous substances that form due to geological and biogeological pro- cesses in the earth. In particular, we concentrate on rock- and ore-forming minerals, which are a small subset of the more than 4000 mineral species that are currently known.", "page": 26}
{"text": "4 SUBJECT AND HISTORY OF MINERALOGY History Mineralogy and crystallography are old branches of science. For example, crystals, with their reg- ular morphology, are known to have fascinated ancient Greek philosophers. Indeed, the name crystal derives from the Greek /H9260/H9267\u00b4/H9271/H9268/H9270/H9251/H9261/H9261/H9265\u03c2(krys- tallos, meaning ice) and was applied to quartz, since the Ancient Greeks thought that this min- eral was water that had crystallized at high pressure deep inside the earth. Accordingly, the German term Bergkristall (meaning \u2018\u2018mountain crystal\u2019\u2019), a synonym for quartz, has survived to this day. Note that the term crystal is also used for glass with a brilliant re\ufb02ection. Such glass is not related to minerals and, in fact, is not even crystalline. In this section we will discuss a few highlights in the early history of mineral- ogy. Those interested in more details will \ufb01nd a great deal of information in Burke (1966), Groth (1926) and Metzger (1918). The Greek philosopher Theophrastus (300 BC), a pupil of Aristotle, wrote the \ufb01rst known book on minerals, entitled On Stones (Caley and Richards, 1956). Similar to the focus of this text, Theophrastus\u2019s book was greatly concerned with the origin of minerals. It begins \u2018\u2018Of those substances formed in the ground, some are made of water and some of earth. Metals obtained by mining come from water; stones, including the precious kinds, come from earth.\u2019\u2019 As we will see later, this statement, although highly simpli\ufb01ed, does contain some truth. Some minerals precip- itate from solutions, others crystallize from a melt. The name mineral originates from Latin and relates to materials that are excavated in mines (mina is the Latin word for \u2018\u2018mine\u2019\u2019, and minare is Latin for \u2018\u2018to mine\u2019\u2019). Pliny the Elder, who was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius in August 79 AD, summarized the knowledge on minerals at his time, describing over 30 minerals in his Historia Naturalis (see Lenz, 1861), among them galena, molybdenite, chalcopyrite, beryl, and augite. The mineralogy of Pliny emphasized minerals that were of economic interest, giving descriptions and discussing their occurrence and usage. For example, he writes about diamond: \u2018\u2018More expensive than all other gems and any other human possessions are diamonds ( adamas). They are only known to kings, and even among them only to a few. Indian diamonds resemble quartz (krystallos). They are transparent, have a regular form with smooth surfaces and are the size of a hazelnut.\u201d It was nearly 1500 years later, with the publication of De Re Metallica in 1556 by the German mining engineer and physician Georg Bauer (known as Agricola) from Freiberg, Saxony (Figure 1.1a), that mineralogy emerged as a sci- ence. Succeeding centuries brought important advances, one of which was the discovery by Niels Stensen (Nicolaus Steno) in 1669 (Figure 1.1b) that angles between the regular faces of crystals are always the same, in spite of differences in shape or size. Probably inspired by the observation of a regular cleavage in calcite by the Swedish min- eralogist Torbern Bergmann (1773), in 1784 the French scientist Ren", "page": 27}
{"text": "\u00b4eJ .H a \u00a8uy (Figure 1.1c) inter- preted this law of constancy of interfacial angles. He suggested that all crystals are composed of el- ementary building blocks, which he called \u2018\u2018inte- gral molecules\u2019\u2019. The building blocks later became known as \u2018\u2018unit cells\u2019\u2019. A macroscopic crystal can be thought of as a three-dimensional periodic array of such unit cells. The regularity of faces and interfacial angles is obvious, for example in a cubic crystal of halite or in an octahedron of magnetite. During the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies, most of the important minerals were described. A.G. Werner, a mining geologist in Freiberg, proposed a chemical classi\ufb01cation of minerals in 1774. This classi\ufb01cation was later re- \ufb01ned by Swedish chemist J.J. Berzelius and is still in use today. It became the basis for the \ufb01rst comprehensive textbooks in mineralogy, such as t h o s eb yH a\u00a8uy (1801), Dana (1837), Breithaupt (1849) and Groth (1904). Mathematicians, among them J.F.C. Hessel (1830), A. Bravais (1850), E.S. Fedorow (1885, 1892), and A. Schoen\ufb02ies (1891) investigated the possible symmetries of a mate- rial with a regular morphology and periodic in- ternal structure, as suggested by Ha \u00a8uy, and de- veloped a system to classify minerals according to symmetry. At that time there was consider- able debate among chemists and mineralogists about whether the concept of internal structure", "page": 27}

Johann Joseph Prechtl (1810) advanced the concept of stacking of spherical particles and hypothesized that \u2018\u2018atoms\u201d had no form in the liquid state but took spherical form during solidi\ufb01cation. The sketches of William Hyde Wollaston (1813; Figure 1.2a) illustrate different arrangements of spheres that are the basis of simple metal structures, as we will see in Chapter 2. While Wollaston thought that all atoms were of the same size, William Barlow (1897) suggested that the size may be characteristic of elements and that a crystal structure of binary compounds could be obtained as close-packing of such spheres. He correctly predicted the structure of halite (Figure 1.2b). But all these theories about the atomic struc- ture of crystals were highly speculative and the issue was only resolved in 1912, when Max von Laue and his co-workers in Munich irradiated crystals with X-rays and observed diffraction, proving that crystals have indeed a lattice struc- ture and that X-rays are waves. At this point mineralogy became an experimental science and expanded considerably, as will be detailed in the succeeding chapters. In 1914 William Lawrence Bragg published the \ufb01rst crystal structure de- termination that described the detailed atomic arrangements.

(b) Barlow (1897) re\ufb01ned the model by assuming different sizes of atoms and correctly predicting the structure of halite. in structural investigations was written by Paul Niggli (1920). If you look through it, you will discover many \ufb01gures that are still reproduced in textbooks today. X-ray diffraction was the fa- vored analytical technique at that time, and, much later, electron microscopes and spectrom- eters were also used. High-temperature and high- pressure techniques eventually became available to produce minerals in the laboratory under any conditions in the earth and beyond. A signi\ufb01cant part of this research on minerals was carried out by physicists and chemists, and the boundaries of mineralogy became more and more blurred. Mineralogy is established both as an indepen- dent science and as a support discipline for many other branches of science (Figure 1.3). Table 1.1 lists some famous mineralogists who have made outstanding contributions to science. The relevance of mineralogy--crystallography, in the context of scienti\ufb01c endeavor, is also high- lighted by the unusual number of Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Medicine that have been awarded for achievements related to crystallog- raphy and research methods used in mineralogy (see Box 1.1). Major directions of investigation Mineralogy is concerned with the characteriza- tion of properties and chemical composition of minerals and the study of the conditions of their formation. Since minerals are substances that concentrate certain chemical elements (such as metals) and disperse others, they are economi- cally important and are studied to de\ufb01ne min- eral resources and exploration techniques. Any mineralogist must be able to identify minerals in order to search for them in the \ufb01eld and to investigate mineral samples with the most important laboratory techniques. Mineralogy is also the science that relates naturally occurring substances of crystalline structure to the more basic sciences of crystallography, chemistry, ma- terials science, and solid-state physics. Mineral- ogy borrows from these disciplines information about the atomic structure, bonding characteris- tics, chemical stability, and growth processes of various compounds, and adopts various analyt- ical methods. In return, mineralogy often pro- vides answers to puzzling features in complex human-made products. We can distinguish several major directions in mineralogical studies. Sometimes they are independent, but often they overlap and cannot be separated. Some investigations may be classi- \ufb01ed as \u2018\u2018basic mineralogy\u2019\u2019, whereas others can be considered as \u2018\u2018applied mineralogy\u2019\u2019; both types of", "page": 29}

Part I deals with the elementary structure of crystals. An intrin- sic feature of crystals is symmetry, and it will be discussed in some detail. Part II introduces macroscopic physical properties. Of the physical properties, the optical properties are most im- portant for petrologists, who study minerals in rocks by means of thin sections with the pet- rographic microscope. Part III deals with the di- versity, classi\ufb01cation, and nomenclature of min- erals. It also explores the conditions and pro- cesses of mineral formation, with a discussion of thermodynamic principles that govern the chem- ical reactions. Part IV contains a systematic sur- vey of the most important minerals, including their structure, diagnostic properties, geological occurrence, and industrial use.

Shull Neutron diffraction mineral names is not the most inspiring aspect of mineralogy, but it is useful to learn the most important minerals and their general composi- tion, just as it is useful in language studies to learn the important words. In addition to reading books on the subject you have to become practi- cally acquainted by working with actual mineral specimens. The lectures in a mineralogy course need to be complemented with a laboratory that uses hand specimens and introduces labo- ratory techniques such as the petrographic mi- croscope and X-ray diffraction. A good start is to visit museum collections that display spectacular and aesthetically beautiful mineral samples. If you have the opportunity, begin collecting some of your own samples in the \ufb01eld, buy some at \ufb02ea markets and bring them to class. For begin- ners, get some specimens \ufb01rst from pegmatites, skarns, and hydrothermal deposits because these predominantly coarse and well-developed crystals can be easily recognized. In the process of these practical exercises, be- gin to use a notebook in which you enter min- eral descriptions. It is enough to allot just half a page to a mineral or a page to a deposit.

Slowly integrate your knowledge so that each mineral becomes an entity with a name, a chem- ical \ufb01ngerprint (for some remember the formula, for complex ones remember at least a list of ma- jor elements), distinguishing features, the geolog- ical system in which they occur, and for many an industrial application (ranging from metal ore to food additive). As you familiarize your- self with mineralogy, minerals will become much more than dry names. They will emerge as mul- tifaceted building blocks that help us to under- stand the processes that govern the earth. Definition of crystal and mineral Before we enter the \ufb01eld let us try to de\ufb01ne crys- tal and mineral. This is a \ufb01rst attempt that will become clearer as we gain more background: r A crystalline substance is a homogeneous chemical compound with a regular and periodic arrangement of atoms. Examples are halite, \u2018\u2018salt\u2019\u2019 (NaCl) and quartz (SiO 2). But crystals are not restricted to minerals: they comprise most solid matter such as sugar (Figure 1.4a), cellulose, metals, bones, and even DNA. r A mineral is a chemical compound that forms by a geological process. Figure 1.4b shows a crystal of halite where the cubic morphology suggests an internal structure with cubic unit cells. Most minerals are crystalline. Test your knowledge 1. What is a mineral? 2.

{"text": "Chapter 2 Elements, bonding, simple structures, and ionic radii Chemical elements Many mineral properties are closely related to the underlying chemical properties of constituent atoms and molecules. Let us start, therefore, by reviewing some fundamental chemistry. The ba- s i cb u i l d i n gu n i to fac r y s t a li st h ea t o m .A t o m s a r ec o m p o s e do fav e r ys m a l lnucleuscontaining positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. Negatively charged electrons, distributed over a much larger volume, surround this nucleus. In the absence of an electric \ufb01eld, an isolated atom has a spherical shape with a diameter of 1--2 \u02daA (1 \u02daangstr\u00a8om = 10 \u221210 meter or 0.1 nanome- ters (nm)) (Figure 2.1a). Electrons are responsi- ble mainly for the chemical behavior of atoms and for bonding, which combines atoms to form larger molecules and crystals. Depending on the number of protons, atoms form different elements with distinct chemical properties. At present 109 elements are known and new ones are being discovered. The atomic number of an element i st h en u m b e ro fp r o t o n sf o u n di na na t o mo f that element. It is also equal to the number of electrons when the atom is in a neutral state. Elements are represented in the Periodic Table (Figure 2.2) by placement into rows and columns that arrange atoms with speci\ufb01c electronic con- \ufb01gurations. In this table the full names of ele- ments, as well as their abbreviated symbols are given. In the simpli\ufb01ed view of the atomic struc- ture formulated by Niels Bohr, electrons are ar- ranged in shells, labeled K, L, M, etc. (Figure 2.1b). Only the K-shell is occupied for elements in the \ufb01rst row of the Periodic Table, the K- and L-shells are occupied for second-row elements, and the K-, L-, and M-shells are occupied for third-row elements. In a qualitative way, with increasing diameter, shells occupy more space and can ac- commodate more electrons: 2, 8, and 18 for K, L and M, respectively. This simple shell model was expanded by L.V. de Broglie, who demonstrated that electrons did not only have particle proper- ties, with positions that can be de\ufb01ned in space and time, but that they also behaved like waves, and were distributed in space in a much more complicated way than on a single orbit. It was Erwin Schr \u00a8odinger who uni\ufb01ed these views in a new model of the atom, based on quantum mechanics. The Schr\u00a8odinger equation, proposed in 1926 and still in wide use today, relates the prob- ability of \ufb01nding an electron at a speci\ufb01c place and a given time to the mass and potential en- ergy of the particle. On the basis of this model it was concluded that electrons in shells do not follow a circular orbit, but are present", "page": 35}
{"text": "with a certain probability and are arranged in orbitals. Up to two electrons can occupy an orbital, each with opposite spin. The distribution of electrons in orbitals has different geometries: s-orbitals are spherical (Figure 2.3a), p-orbitals are directional along three main orthogonal axes (Figure 2.3b), and d-orbitals are of more complicated shapes (Figure 2.3c). There is one s-orbital in each shell, and there can also be up to three p-orbitals and up to \ufb01ve d-orbitals, each occupied by up to two electrons. The K-shell has only s-orbitals, the L-shell s-a n d p-orbitals, the M-shell s-, p-a n d d-orbitals, etc.", "page": 35}

(b) A more detailed view of the Bohr model of the atom reveals that electrons are arranged in shells (K, L, M, etc.). Shells and orbitals are \ufb01lled in a regular fash- ion to maintain the lowest energy. With increas- ing atomic number in each shell \ufb01rst s-, then p- and \ufb01nally d-orbitals are \ufb01lled.

Between Ga and Kr, p-orbitals of the fourth shell are completed. We illustrate the orbital-\ufb01lling process for the element silicon (Si), which has 14 electrons in the neutral state. Two electrons are in the s-orbital of the \ufb01rst (K) shell, and this orbital is denoted as 1s 2 (the superscript 2 indicating that there are two electrons). The K-shell can only haves-orbitals and is therefore full. The next two electrons are in the s-orbital of the second (L) shell, 2s 2, and six electrons are in the p-orbitals of the second shell, two along each axis (2 p2 x ,2 p2 y ,2 p2 z ). This L-shell has only s-a n d p-orbitals and is also full. The remaining four electrons are in the third shell, with two in the s-orbital 3s 2, and two in the p-orbitals 3 px and 3 py . (In principle, the two electrons in the 3 p-orbitals could both be accom- modated in the 3 p2 x -orbital, but this would re- quire a higher energy than 3 px and 3 py do.) The electron distribution of Si can be expressed com- pactly as 1s2 2s2 2px2 2py2 2pz2 KL 3s2 3px 3py M Arrows below the orbitals indicate schematically the electrons and their spins. As we have mentioned, each orbital can ac- commodate two electrons. If there are single elec- trons in an orbital, these so-called valence electrons are easily lost, for example in chemical reactions, owing to low energy barriers. In the case of the silicon atom described above, there are two such valence electrons, 3 p x and 3 py . The highest sta- bility of an electron con\ufb01guration is achieved if an outer electron shell is completely \ufb01lled, which is the case for elements in the last column of the Periodic Table; these are known as the noble or the inert gases.

Examples are quartz (SiO 2), feldspar (CaAl2Si2O8), and olivine (Mg 2SiO4).

Bonding In the solid state, atoms are closely surrounded by neighboring atoms. The forces that bind atoms together are electrical in nature. Their type and intensity are largely responsible for the physical and chemical properties of crystals. These electri- cal forces between atoms are referred to as bonds. Depending on the electronic structure of an atom and its nearest neighbor, the types of bonding f o r c e sc a nv a r y .I ng e n e r a l ,i nt h es o l i ds t a t e at low temperature, where thermal vibration is only moderate, four types of bonding are distin- guished, which we will discuss brie\ufb02y. In metallic bonding some outer electrons have been removed from the atoms and move freely within the struc- ture. The attractive force between the positively charged atoms and the negatively charged elec- tron cloud holds such structures together. The van der Waals bond is a weak overall attraction be- tween neutral atoms; it arises because the elec- tron distribution in atoms is not uniform. Ionic bonding relies on electrostatic attraction between atoms of different charge, where electrons have been removed (positive charge) or added (negative charge). As we will discuss below, such charged atoms are called ions. In covalent bonding,s i n - gle electrons are shared between two atoms in a common orbital. In reality all bonding forces are active in a crystal, but in different minerals some forces can dominate. For example, in halite (NaCl) bonding is largely ionic, whereas in dia- mond (C) it is covalent. Bonding can be mixed, Ionic bonding Halite Corundum Silicates Oxides Halides Forsterite Hornblende Sphalerite Covalent bonding Diamond Galena Sulfides and SulfosaltsNickeline Molybdenite Stibnite Metallic bonding Copper Fig. 2.5 Triangular representation of ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding with some mineral representatives. and different types of bonding may exist between different atoms in a mineral structure. For exam- ple, the important Si---O bond involves covalent and ionic forces. In the case of sulfur, some S---S bonds are largely covalent, whereas others are of the van der Waals type.

In metals, some valence electrons are shared with the whole structure, and move relatively freely. The image of an electron gas between atoms with a positive charge is often used. Bonding is achieved between the positively charged atoms and the electron gas. The mobile electrons are the rea- son for the high electrical and thermal conduc- tivity of metals. The electrical conductivity is expressed in Ohm\u2019s law. (The current I is pro- portional to the applied voltage V and inversely proportional to the resistance R: V = RI.)

The electrostatic attraction of atoms in a metal causes each atom to surround itself by as many neighboring atoms as is geometrically pos- sible. Since atoms have a more or less spherical shape, we obtain a regular geometrical arrange- ment if we place them as closely packed as pos- sible. Arranging spheres of equal size on a plane provides a layer with a hexagonal pattern (open circles in Figure 2.6a). This \ufb01rst layer we call A. Going into the third dimension, the closest stack- ing is achieved if we put atoms into depressions in the \ufb01rst layer (shaded circles in Figure 2.6a). We \ufb01nd that the shaded circles form a second hexagonal layer B that is displaced relative to the \ufb01rst layer. The next layer of atoms we put into depressions of the B layer, directly over the \ufb01rst layer. Since the third layer is exactly over the \ufb01rst layer, we call it A again and Figure 2.6b shows a three-dimensional view of this stacking ABA, which can be repeated to in\ufb01nity in a macro- scopic crystal (ABABAB . . . ). The arrangement of atoms is known as a crystal structure,a n d ,i nt h i s particular case, the arrangement is close-packed because there is a minimum of open space be- tween atoms. The array of atoms displays a hexag- onal pattern if viewed from above (Figure 2.6a), ap r o p e r t yw ew i l ll a t e rr e f e rt oa ssymmetry. This arrangement is known as hexagonal close-packed structure, often abbreviated as hcp. Metals such as beryllium, titanium, zinc, and zirconium crystal- lize in this structure type. There is an alternative way of stacking close- packed layers. Instead of placing the third layer exactly over the \ufb01rst layer, we can position it over the depressions in the \ufb01rst layer that were not used for the second layer. Layer C in Figure 2.7a shows this (shaded spheres). In this case, only the fourth layer stacks over the \ufb01rst layer and the sequence repeats. As Figure 2.7b illustrates, the stacking ABCA looks like a pyramid and not only the base but each of the three sides of the pyra- mid is a close-packed layer. In Figure 2.7c a more extensive sequence of this stacking is shown (AB- CABC . . . ) and the pyramid is tilted so that it \ufb01ts into a cube.

This structure type (with ABC) stacking is known as cubic close-packed, or face-centered cubic (fcc). It is a very important structure type and elements such as aluminum, copper, and gold have such an atomic arrangement. In both stacking patterns each atom has 12 closest neighbors, six in the same plane, and three above and three below (see e.g., Figure 2.6a). We say that the coordination number (CN) is 12. Both structures are equally economical in occu- pying space and represent the densest packing of spheres (74% of the volume is occupied).

(c) The structure is extended and then tilted to \ufb01t into a cube. A small cube (lower right corner) identi\ufb01es the unit cell, with centers of atoms on corners and face centers. Rather than using representations of crystal structures as stacks or clusters of atoms as in Figures 2.6b and 2.7c, crystallographers prefer a more transparent system, similar to Ha \u00a8uy\u2019s con- cept of elementary building blocks that repeat in three dimensions, alluded to in Chapter 1. These building blocks are called unit cells, and we will discuss them systematically in Chapter 3, introducing just the basics here. Unit cells are polyhedra with three pairs of parallel faces that repeat periodically in three dimensions. To visu- alize these polyhedra more easily, we show atoms at a smaller-than-actual size relative to their in- teratomic distances, leaving space between them. T h i sa l l o w su st ob e t t e rs e et h eu n i tc e l li n t e r i o r . Doing so, it is quite easy to identify a unit polyhe- dron in the ABAB stacking (Figure 2.6c). The unit cell of the hcp structure, which we can repeat by translation to cover all atoms in the crystal, is highlighted in Figure 2.8a. It consists of rhom- boids at the base and at the top, with rectangles as sides. Atoms are at the corners (A) and one inside the polyhedron (B), above one of the trian- gles in the A layer. In the case of the fcc structure, a cubic unit cell is chosen as outlined in Figure 2.7c, lower right, and highlighted in Figure 2.8b. In this representation we can immediately see atoms at the corners and the centers of faces of the cube. Since interatomic distances are similar, there is only a relatively small difference in lattice en- ergy between the fcc and hcp structures for a given metal. However, the mechanical properties of metals crystallizing in the two structures are very different. Hcp metals have only a single set of close-packed layers, whereas fcc metals have four equivalent sets (corresponding to the four body diagonals). The close-packed layers act as slip planes during deformation. Fcc metals such as copper, aluminum, gold and silver with many equivalent slip planes are ductile, whereas hcp metals such as beryllium, zinc, titanium, and zir- conium are much more brittle and dif\ufb01cult to de- form. This difference in deformation properties is signi\ufb01cant for technological applications.

In the case of bcc (c), second-closest neighbors are shown (light shading) and connected by dotted lines. van der Waals bonding van der Waals bonding is produced by a weak attraction between atoms. A slightly irregular distribution of electrons in the outermost shell causes charge \ufb02uctuations. This is due to the very dynamic nature of the electron distribution, with locally changing charge densities. It causes a ran- dom and very brief formation of dipoles between two atoms. Inert gases crystallize with van der Waals bonding. In minerals, van der Waals bond- ing is only important for speci\ufb01c bonds, such as between layers in the silicate mineral talc, or car- bon layers in graphite, and between rings of eight sulfur atoms in native sulfur. Ionic bonding An atom becomes ionized if it attains inert gas con\ufb01guration by loss or gain of one or more elec- trons. Halite (NaCl) is a good mineral example for ionic bonding. Sodium loses an electron to form the neon con\ufb01guration: Na (1s 2 2s2 2p6 3s1) \u2212 e\u2212 \u2192 Na+(1s2 2s2 2p6), and chlorine gains an electron to have the argon con\ufb01guration: Cl (1s 2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5) + e\u2212 \u2192 Cl\u2212 (1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6). The ion with the positive charge is called a cation, that with the negative charge an anion. Ionic bonding is basically due to the electro- static attraction between oppositely charged ions and therefore subject to Coulomb\u2019s law, which describes the relationship between the attractive or repulsive force F , point charges q 1 and q2,a n d their distance d (Figure 2.9a): F \u2248 (q1 \u00d7 q2)/d2 (2.1) If we consider a very simple ionic structure where ions are spherical and in contact and only take nearest-neighbor interactions into account (Figure 2.9b), this can be rephrased as F \u2248 (e+ 1 \u00d7 e\u2212 2 )/(r1 + r2)2 (2.2) where e1 and e2 are the ionic charges of cation and anion, and r1 and r2 are the radii of the (a) q1 q2 d (b) r1 _ r2 + e1 e2 Fig. 2.9 Coulomb\u2019s law.

(c) Each Na+ is surrounded by six Cl\u2212 and we can display this relationship by drawing an octahedron (shaded), known as a coordination polyhedron. corresponding ions. We can use this simpli\ufb01ed formulation to understand some features of ionic structures. The strength of the attraction F cor- relates with the melting point. Thus, for sodium halides with a 1 + charge, the melting point decreases with increasing interatomic distance (r 1 + r2): Compound Interatomic Melting distance point (\u02daA) ( \u25e6C) NaF 2.31 988 NaCl 2.79 801 NaBr 2.94 740 NaI 3.18 660 On the other hand, for two crystals of the same structure and similar interatomic distance, the melting point increases with the ionic charge: Compound Charge Interatomic Melting distance point (\u02daA) ( \u25e6C) NaF 1 2.31 988 CaO 2 2.40 2570 Among minerals, ionic bonding is prevalent such as in halite, with alternating Na + and Cl \u2212 that are in contact (Figure 2.10a). Again it is easier for visualization purposes to draw atoms as small spheres with exaggerated interatomic spac- ing. In so doing we recognize a cube-shaped unit cell with Cl \u2212 in the corners (Figure 2.10b). Each Na+ is surrounded by six Cl \u2212 (Figure 2.10c, in- dicated by dotted lines) and vice versa. We will discuss this structure in more detail later in this chapter. Ionic structures, at least of simple binary compounds, typically display fairly high symmetry. Covalent bonding Whereas ions lose or gain electrons to achieve a more stable con\ufb01guration, covalently bonded atoms share electrons to \ufb01ll partially occupied orbitals. For example, two chlorine atoms com- bine to form a Cl 2 molecule: ClCl ClCl The covalent bond is directional between two atoms. The directionality is particularly empha- sized for p-orbitals with p x , py ,a n d pz aligned more or less along orthogonal axes. A good ex- ample is water (H 2O).

This is not strictly true, however, because hydrogen and oxygen atoms are slightly ionized and thus an electrostatic repulsion between the slightly positive hydro- gen atoms causes the angle to open to 104.5 \u25e6 (Figure 2.11b). Perhaps the best mineral example for covalent bonding is diamond. The electronic con\ufb01guration of an isolated carbon atom is 1s2 2s2 2px 2py In diamond crystals this electron con\ufb01guration is complicated by the in\ufb02uences from neighbor- ing atoms that cause electrons in 2s -orbitals and p-orbitals to change places, resulting in four un- paired orbitals with overlapping energies in what is called hybridization: 1s2 2s 2px 2py 2pz In order for such a hybridized carbon atom to be stable, it must be bonded with four neighbors, sharing their orbitals. This is illustrated with a simple two-dimensional scheme (each arrow rep- resents an electron): C C C C C C C C C C C C CCCC In diamond this bonding is not achieved in a planar con\ufb01guration as in the sketch above, but rather in three dimensions, where each carbon atom is surrounded by four neighbors (Figure 2.12, dotted lines) in the form of a tetrahe- dron (Figure 2.12, shaded).

T etrahedra are connected over corners. covalent structures, owing to their directionality, are of low symmetry, and there is no tendency to- wards close-packing. In these simple models, van der Waals bond- ing is the weakest type of bonding, followed by metallic and ionic. Covalent bonding is strongest. For more detailed treatments on bonding, one should consult textbooks on chemistry and solid- state physics. For example, in metallic bonding the wave nature of electrons and the fact that electrons are not really free but are constrained by quantum considerations are addressed by the Bloch theory.

Also, for many purposes, atoms in crys- tals with metallic and ionic bonding can be ap- proximated by spheres. It is dif\ufb01cult to assign an absolute size to these spheres, since the overall electron density decreases gradually with increas- ing distance from the nucleus. However, between ions in a crystal structure such as that of halite (Figure 2.10a) there is a balance between attrac- tive and repulsive forces. This is shown schemati- cally in Figure 2.13. Coulomb attraction discussed earlier is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the center of the ions (dashed curve). This attraction is countered by a strong repulsion as electron shells of anion and cation begin to overlap, known as Born repulsion, as well as repulsion between positively charged nuclei (dotted curve). The net force is a difference between the two (solid curve) and it is balanced at a certain equilibrium separation. So a model for ionic crystal structures that assumes ions are hard spheres of \ufb01xed radius and in contact is ex- tremely useful. In such a model the interatomic distance d between a cation A + and an anion X \u2212 is the sum of the radii r+ A and r\u2212 X of the two ions. The sum of two radii can be derived from the atomic positions that are determined experimen- tally by X-ray diffraction methods (Chapter 7).

The radii of neutral atoms, especially of met- als, can also be determined from the shortest distances between atoms in metallic structures. Obviously, the model of hard spheres is better for ionic, metallic, or van der Waals structures than for covalent ones, where binding forces are directed and the electron density distribution is nonspherical. On the basis of our present understanding of atomic structure, the calculations of radii have been re\ufb01ned, and more accurate atomic dimen- sions are now available.

We keep the size of the anions constant and reduce the size of the cation. The anions come closer to the cation centers and, therefore, bonding in the crystal structure becomes stronger. This is since the energy to separate the crystal into ionic species depends primarily on Coulomb attraction between cations and anions, which increases with decreasing distance (equa- tion 2.1).

As we reduce the radius of the cation to the size when anions were touching in the square con\ufb01guration (Figure 2.17b, middle), anions still do not touch. Only at a much smaller radius do anions and cations touch (Figure 2.17b, right). Therefore for triangular coordination the lattice energy still de- creases up to a much smaller value of cation ra- dius (Figure 2.18, CN = 3) and for small cations the triangular con\ufb01guration is therefore advanta- geous and allows for closer packing with reduced lattice energy. The ideal cation : anion radius ratio ( r A:rX), when both cations and anions are touching, can be calculated from geometrical considerations (Box 2.1). The same method can be used to determine the critical radius ratios for three-dimensional coordination polyhedra. For 12-fold coordination, corresponding to simple close-packing, the radius ratio r A : rX is 1.0. Table 2.2 lists the most common coordination polyhedra in minerals (3, 4, 6, 8,", "page": 50}

Applying Pythagoras\u2019 theorem we obtain 2(r A + r X)2 = 4r 2 X (2.3) Taking the square root this reduces to r A + r X = \u221a2rX (2.4) and solving this equation for r A we obtain r A = (\u221a2 \u2212 1)r X = 0.414rX (2.5) Triangular coordination (Figure 2.19b) We consider a right triangle with two corners in the centers of anions, and the third corner halfway between two anions.

In most mineral structures, the cations are smaller than the anions and there are also often more anions than cations (e.g., olivine (Mg 2SiO4), kyanite (Al2SiO5), pyrite (FeS2)). The anions there- fore dominate the total volume and arrange themselves in a close-packed structure to mini- mize the energy, just as atoms do in hcp and fcc metals (see Figures 2.6 and 2.7). In a close-packed arrangement of spheres, there are two types of polyhedral interstices (spaces) between the spheres.

{"text": "30 ELEMENTS, BONDING, SIMPLE STRUCTURES, AND IONIC RADII Some general rules concerning ionic structures In the previous sections we have explored charac- teristic features of ionic structures. Electrostatic attraction between anions and cations, and the size of the ions, determine many features of crys- tal structures. The ionic bond relies on charge balance, even on a local scale, and deviations from local charge balance render a structure un- stable. The in\ufb02uence of electrostatic attraction and repulsion on crystal structures, and the ef- fects of charge balance/imbalance are summa- rized in rules \ufb01rst formulated by Linus Pauling in 1929. We review three of them below. When- ever a rule for ionic structures is violated, it is an indication that the structure is not truly ionic. 1. A coordination polyhedron of anions is formed about each cation. The cation--anion dis- tance is determined by the sum of the ionic radii. The coordination number of the cation depends on the radius ratio. This is an expression of the rigid sphere concept with spheres in contact. 2. The electrostatic valency principle expresses that the electrostatic charges should be balanced between closest neighbors. This can be evaluated quantitatively by introducing the concept of the total strength of the valency bond p,d e \ufb01 n e da s the ratio of cation charge z to the coordination number CN and representing the number of elec- trons per bond: p = z/CN (2.9) In a stable coordinated structure, the sum of the bond strengths for all bonds that reach an anion from all the neighboring cations is equal to the absolute value of the charge y of the anion. /Sigma1p = /Sigma1(z/CN) =| y| (2.10) An example is halite (Figure 2.10c), where Na + is surrounded by 6 Cl \u2212 with a charge of 1 ( p = 1/6). Each Cl \u2212 h a s6N a+ as next neighbors and summing over all these six bonds (6 \u00d7 1/6 = 1), we obtain the charge of the anion. 3.

{"text": "Chapter 3 The concept of a lattice and description of crystal structures Discovery of the lattice In Chapter 2 we saw how interatomic bonding forces determine the internal structure of crys- tals. For example, in the case of close-packing in a metal, atoms repeat periodically in three dimen- sions. A translation of an atom by an interatomic distance superposes it on the next atom. In ionic and covalent structures, the atomic arrangement is more complicated and ion groups or molecules repeat, rather than individual atoms. A regu- lar internal crystal structure was proposed in the eighteenth century, based on some unique macroscopic properties of crystals. The concept of a periodic crystal structure was developed from observations of the plane faces that are ob- served on freely growing crystals, the characteris- tic angles between faces, and the regular cleavage that is observed in many minerals. Only much later, in the twentieth century, was it determined that this regular and periodic internal structure was due to the regular bonding forces between atoms. In 1669, Nicolas Steno discovered that the an- gles between corresponding faces of quartz crys- tals are always the same, irrespective of the ac- tual size of the faces. At that time science moved at a slow pace. Over 50 years later, in 1723, Michael A. Cappeller observed that each mineral species has a characteristic set of interfacial an- gles (these angles can be measured with a pro- tractor) and proposed a law of constant interfacial angles for minerals in general (Figure 3.1). For ex- ample, a magnetite crystal may occur as a perfect octahedron (Figure 3.2a) or as distorted octahedra (Figure 3.2b,c). In either case the angles between faces are identical. In 1773 Torbern Bergmann studied the regular cleavage of calcite. If a calcite crystal is crushed, it breaks into small fragments that take the shape of little rhombohedra. If one of these little rhombohedra is crushed again, it forms a set of even smaller rhombohedra of mi- croscopic scale. Similar observations were made for halite, except that the small fragments were not rhombohedra but rather cubes. Bergmann supposed that these small fragments might be the building blocks of crystals. A few years later, in 1784, Ren\u00b4eJ .H a \u00a8uy came up with an ingenious theory to explain both the growth morphology and the regular cleavage of crystals. He proposed that all crystals are built up from elementary par- allelepipeds (Figure 3.3a), \ufb01lling space without gaps (a parallelepiped is a polyhedron consisting of three pairs of parallel faces). This model ex- plains, for example, the morphology of a dodec- ahedron as faces bordering stacks of cubic par- allelepipeds (Figure 3.3a) and we are very much reminded of Ha \u00a8uy\u2019s concept from a modern SEM image of the growth pattern in a europium-- tellurium alloy (Figure 3.3b).

In order to better understand the array of par- allelepipeds, it is useful to abstract each cell and its content by a point. The crystal can then be idealized by a three-dimensional periodic array of points (Figure 3.4c). The law of interfacial an- gles now becomes obvious: crystal faces are dis- crete planes containing points of this array, and crystal edges are lines of points. Angles are there- fore determined by the geometry of the array and are not arbitrary. Ludwig August Seeber, in 1824, introduced the term lattice for this regu- lar array of points. A lattice is periodic in three dimensions and has the property that the envi- ronment of each point is identical and in the same orientation. If you could place yourself in a lattice point and observe all of the neighbor- ing points, the perspective would be the same no matter which point you picked. The unit cell is the parallelepiped formed by eight lattice points.

To fully describe the internal structure of a crystal, two pieces of information are needed. First, one must characterize the geometry of the unit cell and therefore the lattice. Second, one must identify the content of the unit cell, i.e., the type and position of the atoms or ions. The atomic arrangement in the unit cell is called the crystal structure. The macroscopic crystal is then obtained by a periodic repetition of the unit cell through translation. Symmetry considerations Early mineralogists such as Steno and Ha\u00a8uy noted an extraordinary feature of crystals, namely their distinctive symmetry. While symmetry is a uni- versal principle (see Box 3.1), it is most succinctly expressed in the morphology and structure of crystals, and, in fact, symmetry theory was devel- oped largely by crystallographers. We refer to an object as being symmetrical if it can be moved in some way and yet appears exactly as before. For example, in Figure 3.5a a hand is shown. A single hand is asymmetrical and represents the symme- try motif for the remaining parts of the \ufb01gure. In Figure 3.5b the hand is repeated by transla- tion, forming an array of three identical (or con- gruent) hands. We call this pattern with a set of three hands symmetrical because if we translate t h e\ufb01 r s th a n db yav e c t o r t, it superposes exactly on the second hand. Translation, symbol t, is a symmetry operation producing a simple shift of the motif. Figure 3.5c shows a ring of six identical hands. In this case applying 60 \u25e6 rotations around an axis perpendicular to the ring (and the page) gener- ates the set of six hands. The seventh rotation superposes the next hand exactly on the \ufb01rst one. Rotation is another symmetry operation, and a rotation axis is the corresponding symmetry el- ement. In Figure 3.5c we have a 6-fold rotation, the rotation angle (\u03c6 )i s6 0 \u25e6, and the symbol is a hexagon. There are other rotation angles, as we will soon learn. Yet another way to repeat an object is shown in Figure 3.5d. In this case the pair of hands is re- lated by a mirror re\ufb02ection. The symmetry oper- ation is called mirror reflection, symbol m, and the corresponding symmetry element a mirror plane. Contrary to the pattern with translated or ro- tated hands, mirror re\ufb02ection does not produce an identical repetition. Each element of the sym- metric motif on the right-hand side is an equal distance from the mirror plane on the left-hand side, in this case producing a left hand from a right hand. Such a repetition is called enantiomor- phous, to distinguish it from a congruent repeti- tion in the cases", "page": 57}

Another important aspect of symmetrical pat- terns is that the \ufb01nal pattern is formed by a con- tinued repetition until the initial motif is itself reproduced. For translation, this property is ob- vious because the translation operation always repeats the motif. In the case of re\ufb02ection, this return to the original motif is accomplished by the initial re\ufb02ection from left to right and then back again from right to left. In the case of rota- tion we must return to the original hand after a \ufb01nite number of incremental rotations. This", "page": 57}

Let us now return to the crystal structure of halite, examining it in terms of its symmetry el- ements (Figure 3.6). We easily \ufb01nd 4-fold rotation Box 3.1 Symmetry in art and nature While symmetry is most conspicuous and is clearly expressed in crystals, sym- metry is omnipresent. Take, for example, the prehistoric polychrome plate from Mesopotamia in Figure 3.7a, showing a 4-fold rotation axis and mirror planes. This archetypal symmetrical pattern was used much later in pottery of early Christianity and perfected in the art of the Islam. While cultures in the Western world on the whole preferred mirror symmetry, Native Americans almost exclusively used ro- tational symmetry elements, as displayed in a pre-Columbian Mimbres bowl from New Mexico (Figure 3.7b). The artist who is best known for the use of symmetry in graphics is M.C. Escher, whose drawings include not only rotational and mir- ror symmetries but also translational symmetries and periodic arrangements of motifs having many similarities to crystal structures (Figure 3.7c). Greek temples emphasize translation by the repetition of pillars; Romanesque churches have al- most perfect mirror symmetry. Symmetry is not restricted to pottery, paintings or architecture. Johann Sebastian Bach also used it extensively in his compositions. Throughout Bach\u2019sArt of the Fugue, for example, we \ufb01nd translations and mirror re\ufb02ections that were intentionally applied to achieve artistic effects (Figure 3.7d). In the natural world, symmetry is present not only in minerals but also in living organisms. Examples include rotation axes in plants such as a 3-fold axis in aTrillium lily (Figure 3.8a), or a 5-fold axis in a star\ufb01sh (Figure 3.8b), and mirror planes in vertebrates (Figure 3.8c). Interestingly in the last two cases the symmetry is only external (the heart being on the left side, and the right and left sides of the brain differing in the case of vertebrates). Carl van Linn\u00b4 e (Linnaeus) used symmetry as a guiding principle for his classi\ufb01cation of plants. axes perpendicular to the faces of the cube ( \u25a0 ), but there are also 3-fold rotation axes along the body diagonals (\u25b2).

There are a number of constraints one must consider in choosing a unit cell. In Chapter 2 we discussed some simple crystal struc- tures such as halite (NaCl), which contains regu- larly alternating chloride and sodium ions. Let us make a list of general considerations for unit cells and how these apply to the NaCl example: 1. A unit cell must be large enough to contain an inte- gral number of formula units. Thus, the unit cell", "page": 60}
{"text": "38 CONCEPT OF A LATTICE AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURES of halite must contain at least one sodium and one chloride ion. 2. Each corner of a unit cell must be identical, with an identical environment. If this were not the case we could not repeat the unit cell by transla- tion to form a periodic crystal. If we place Cl \u2212 in one corner of the unit cell of halite, Cl \u2212 must occupy all corners. 3. A unit cell must express the symmetry of the atomic relationship. In the case of the NaCl structure, we have seen above that the symmetry is ex- pressed in rotation axes and mirror planes (Fig- ure 3.6). A unit cell in the shape of a cube, with either Cl \u2212 or Na+ in the corners, best expresses this symmetry. Unit cells are classi\ufb01ed based on their sym- metry. The three 4-fold rotation axes at right an- gles in the NaCl unit cell identify the unit cell as cubic because the unit parallelepiped has the shape of a cube (Figure 3.6). (Also characteris- tic for the symmetry of a cube are four 3-fold axes in the directions of the body diagonals.) This is the highest possible symmetry. Such unit cells have equal sides and right angles between edges. On the other end of the symmetry spectrum are triclinic unit cells, where adjoining edges are of different lengths and are at oblique angles to one another (Figure 3.9a).

{"text": "UNIT CELL AS THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF A CRYSTAL 41 Box 3.2 Some conventions for choosing a unit cell r Symmetry is the primary criterion for choosing a unit cell. The highest possible symmetry is preferable. This is illustrated for a two-dimensional case, where a unit cell is a parallelogram. In the array of points in Figure 3.13a, we pick a cell that conforms to the mirror plane of the pattern (shaded), rather than an oblique cell. In this particular case the unit cell has a point in the center, in addition to the points in the corners and is said to be centered. A unit cell with points only in the corners is called primitive. r Smaller cells are preferred over larger cells and thus, in two dimensions, a small parallelogram with lattice points only in the corners is better than a larger par- allelogram that has additional lattice points (Figure 3.13b), unless the symmetry criterion requires such a choice (Figure 3.13a). r A cell that is the least distorted and its angles closest to 90\u25e6 is preferred, mainly for reasons of easier visualization (Figure 3.13c). r In assigning vectors a, b, c to the cell edges, the axes x, y, z must form a right- handed coordinate system (Figure 3.9b). r Vector c (z-axis) is along the axis that has the highest rotational symmetry (3-, 4-, and 6-fold axis). An exception is a lattice with a single 2-fold axis (called monoclinic), in which case the 2-fold axis is along b (the y-axis). r In general, cell lengths are ordered such that b > a > c (although for minerals many exceptions exist). r Angles \u03b1, \u03b2, if not 90 \u25e6, are obtuse (>90 \u25e6) between the positive ends of axes and as close as possible to 90\u25e6 to have least distortion (Figure 3.13c). 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-fold. If we combine a 2-fold ro- tation with a mirror plane (Figure 3.12h), we ob- tain a rectangular array of points. This symmetry is maintained if the next layer is exactly above the \ufb01rst (Figure 3.12h), or diagonally displaced (Figure 3.12i). The same symmetry also applies to a pattern with a rhombus-shaped array with the second layer above the \ufb01rst (Figure 3.12j), or translated (Figure 3.12k). We have just added four more lattices with a 2-fold axis and a parallel mir- ror plane to our set of seven. There is one more special type, which can be derived from the square pattern: If we place the second layer above the \ufb01rst, just as in Figure 3.12d, but at the same distance between layers as the distance x between lattice points within a layer, a cubic array results that has three 4-fold axes, with one perpendicular to each face of the cube (Figure 3.12l). This symmetry, with three 4-fold axes, is maintained if the second layer is displaced to the center of each square and at a height x/2 (Figure 3.12m).

Unit cells in the 14 Bravais lattices are shown in Figure 3.14. The symmetry of each is differ- ent, as is expressed in angles between the axes and relative lengths of the axes (we will explain this in more detail below). Note that seven of the unit cells have lattice points only in the corners. They constitute the seven primitive lattices desig- n a t e db yas y m b o lP. The other seven Bravais lat- tices have the same unit cells as a corresponding primitive cell, but in addition either have lattice points in the center of the cell and are called body-centered (symbol I ,f o r\u2018 \u2018 i n s i d e \u2019 \u2019 ) ,o re l s e they have a lattice point at the center of one pair of faces or of all pairs of faces and are called face- centered (symbols C for centering of a face cut by the z-axis, and F for centering of all faces, respec- tively). The special rhombohedral cell, which is a variant of the stacking of hexagonal lattice layers (Figure 3.12g), is assigned a symbol R. There are restrictions about adding points to primitive lattices, as is illustrated in Figure 3.15 for the two-dimensional case. In general, adding points (open circles in Figure 3.15a) is not compat- ible with a lattice, because the two sets of points (open and solid circles) have a different arrange- ment of closest neighbors. However, if points are added in the center of a face (in two dimensions; see Figure 3.15b) it does not destroy the lattice character. After adding points to a point array, one must determine whether the symmetry has changed and whether the new array is really dif- ferent. In the case of the rectangular unit cell (Figure 3.15b), the symmetry is maintained (two mirror planes) and the pattern is different. In the primitive cell, closest neighbors are at right an- gles (Figure 3.15a); in the face-centered cell, they are at oblique angles (Figure 3.15b). If points are added in the center of a hexagonal unit cell (open circles in Figure 3.15c), the hexagonal symmetry is destroyed and there is no longer a 6-fold axis.

This is called the cubic system (also known as isomet- ric). The lattice parameters and rotational axes for the seven crystal systems are summarized in Table 3.1. Representation of lattice lines and planes with rational indices Macroscopic features such as faces and edges on a crystal, as well as microscopic structures, such as lattice planes and lattice directions are es- sential to describe crystals and we need to have a simple system to describe them. It turns out that the unit cell is a very convenient coordi- nate reference frame to represent lattice lines and planes. In the following discussion we re- place the stack of unit cells by their corners and represent the internal crystal structure by a point lattice. Thus each point of a lattice is, by de\ufb01nition, identical, and, since the lattice ex- tends to in\ufb01nity in all dimensions, the choice of an origin for the lattice coordinate system is arbitrary. In a lattice we can identify linear features called directions or lines, and planar features called planes. Figure 3.16a illustrates a lattice line as a straight line passing through any two lat- tice points, and lattice planes as planes passing through any three lattice points. A lattice plane contains an in\ufb01nite number of coplanar lattice lines. A crystal often displays a set of planar faces (Figure 3.16b), de\ufb01ning a polyhedron. Faces cor- respond to lattice planes, and the intersection of two faces de\ufb01nes an edge, corresponding to a lat- tice line.

Lattice directions such as r in Figure 3.17a can be identi\ufb01ed relative to the crystal lattice with axes x, y,a n d z. A \ufb01rst step is to translate the line through the arbitrary origin (O). Then we can describe the line with the vector equation, r = ua + vb + wc, where r is the vector from the origin to the closest lattice point on the line; a, b, c are unit vectors along the three crystal axes and outline the unit cell. As an example, lattice line [132] is shown in Figure 3.17a. The values u, v, w are integers, called direction or zone axis in- dices, that are identi\ufb01ed by putting them inside brackets [uvw]. Using zone axis indices the sym- bol [100] would denote the x-axis, having only the single vector component a (Figure 3.17b). Other examples shown are [111], [012], and [011]. When the direction, rather than the length, of a lattice line is of interest, it is customary to reduce zone indices by dividing them by a common denomi- nator of the nonzero indices; for example, [022] becomes [011], and [396] becomes [132]. Geomet- rically this means that the index corresponds to the \ufb01rst lattice point (from the origin) that the direction intersects. A bar above an index indi- cates that the corresponding vector component is negative, for example [ \u00af100] points in the nega- tive x-direction (read: bar-one zero zero). Similar indices can also be used to specify lattice planes, although this process is a bit more complicated. First, we center our macro- scopic crystal in the x, y, z coordinate system such that the center of the crystal is at the origin (Figure 3.18a). Then we extend each face so that it intersects all three axes, which is shown for faces A and B in Figure 3.18a. We now translate the lattice plane represented by each face until the intersection of the plane along all three axes corresponds to a lattice point. The axis intersec- tion points of each lattice plane are then sim- ply multiples of the unit cell lengths, i.e., ma, nb, and oc. In Figure 3.18b, for example, lat- tice plane A is de\ufb01ned by axis intercepts 2 a, 2b, and 1c . The \u2018\u2018axis intercept\u2019\u2019 integers m, n, and o are called Weiss indices (Weiss, 1819) and are used to describe the orientation of a lat- tice plane with respect to the x, y, z axes.

It is important to distinguish between Miller indices for lattice planes (hkl) and direction in- dices for lattice lines [uvw]. Only for orthogo- nal unit cells is the plane (100) perpendicular to the direction [100], and only for cubic crystals is the general plane (hkl) perpendicular to the lattice direction [ u = hv = kw = l]. To visualize lattice planes from their Miller indices, it is also important to remember that an index 0 indicates that the plane is parallel to the corresponding axis and does not intersect it. Some examples of common lattice planes and their general Miller indices are shown in Figure 3.19, taken from the classic book of Paul Niggli (1920). Note that all of these indices are integers, no matter what the symmetry of the crystal is or what the actual lattice parameters are. This ele- gant description, however, relies on the unit cell as a reference system, and thus knowledge about the lattice parameters is necessary if we need to obtain angular relationships. To illustrate this point, consider the following example: Determine the angle between lattice planes (001) and (112) for a tetragonal crystal with a = 5 a A, b = 5 a A, and c = 8 a A. r First we convert the Miller indices (001) to Weiss indices. The result is \u221e\u221e1. The plane (001) does not intersect the x-a n d y-axes, i.e., it is parallel to the x-a n dy-axes and intersects the z- axis at OC = 1c. For simplicity we also translate it and draw it as the plane xy in Figure 3.20a (OAB), intersecting z at 0 (since only angular relationships are of concern, parallel translations of planes are always allowed).", "page": 70}

In order to draw the plane we have to obtain the axis intercepts, multiplying the Weiss indices by the corresponding cell lengths. The intercept along the x- a x i si sO A=2a = 10 a A, along the y- a x i si ti sO B=2b = 10 a A, and along the z- a x i si ti sO C=1c = 8 a A. r Now we can plot the lattice plane ABC in the three-dimensional sketch shown in Figure 3.20a. We also draw the trace of the lattice plane (112) on (001), projected along the z-axis, in Figure 3.20b. r The true angle \u03c6 between the two planes can be measured in the triangle OXC (Figure 3.20c). r We obtain OX as OA/\u221a 2 = 7.07 a A (Figure 3.20b). r In triangle OXC we then have tan\u03c6 = OC/OX = 8 a A/7.07 a A = 1.13, from which we get the \ufb01nal answer, \u03c6 = 48\u25e6. Similar calculations can be done for other unit cells. Of course the geometry (and trigonom- etry) becomes more complicated for unit cells with lower symmetry. Miller and direction indices are applicable to all symmetries. However, in the case of hexagonal crystals, often a modi\ufb01ed four-index system is used to account for the fact that there are three equivalent axes ( a 1,a2 and a3) perpendicular to the z-axis (Box 3.3). Relations between lattice planes and lattice lines: A lattice line is the intersection of two lattice planes. Therefore we should be able to derive the corresponding direction indices [uvw] for this line from the Miller indices of the two intersecting planes (h 1k1l1)a n d(h2k2l2). The equations for two planes through the origin are given by h1x + k1 y + l1z = 0 (3.2a) h2x + k2 y + l2z = 0 (3.2b) where x, y, z are the coordinates for all points on these planes. For the intersecting line, both equations must be satis\ufb01ed, and here the ratio x : y : z corresponds to the direction symbols u :v : w. Since we only need the ratios, the two equations with three unknowns can be solved: (k1l2 \u2212 k2l1):( l1h2 \u2212 l2h1):( h1k2 \u2212 h2k1)", "page": 71}
{"text": "LATTICE LINES AND PLANES WITH RATIONAL INDICES 49 Box 3.3 Miller\u2013Bravais indices in the hexagonal system Hexagonal crystals are a somewhat special case. They have a unique c-axis, but perpendicular to it are three equivalent axes a1, a2, and a3 (Figure 3.21). There is no reason to give preference to one of them. Accordingly, a coordi- nate system with four axes is often used, one along the 6-fold rotation axis ( c) and three axes perpendicular to it ( a1, a2, and a3), separated by angles of 120 \u25e6. The a3-axis is not independent of a1 and a2 and can, in principle, be omit- ted as we have done in Figure 3.14. In fact, as the following discussion demon- strates, it is rather awkward to use four indices for a three-dimensional space, yet it is done conventionally for crystal forms, and mineralogists have to be aware of it. In the hexagonal system Miller indices are extended to Miller\u2013Bravais indices (hkil) to better highlight the hexagonal symmetry. Figure 3.21a is a two-dimensional representation of a hexagonal lattice, showing only one lattice plane. The third dimension (c) is irrelevant in this discussion. From this \ufb01gure we derive that i = \u2212(h + k), for example the Miller plane (110) is equivalent to the Miller\u2013Bravais plane (11\u00af20), intersecting a 3 at \u22121 2 , and the Miller plane (\u00af1\u00af20) is equivalent to the Miller\u2013Bravais plane (\u00af1\u00af230). Likewise, four index direction symbols [u \u2032v \u2032tw ] can be used, where t = \u2212(u\u2032 + v \u2032)o ru \u2032 + v \u2032 + t = 0. While the conversion from three to four index lattice plane symbols is easy (simply adding i =\u2212 (h + k)), the conversion is more dif\ufb01cult for vector symbols. The description of a three-dimensional vec- tor as a combination of three vectors, r = ua 1 + va1 + w c, is unique, but there is an in\ufb01nite number of ways to describe a vector as a combination of four vectors, three of which are coplanar, r = u \u2032a1 + v \u2032a2 + ta3 + w c.H o w - ever, only one combination satis\ufb01es the same rule applicable to Miller\u2013Bravais plane indices, namely t =\u2212 (u \u2032 + v \u2032). J.D.H. Donnay (1947) derives the conver- sion. Take point P in the plane a1, a2, a3 of Figure 3.21b that is de\ufb01ned by vec- tors ma1 + na2 + 0a3. The \ufb01gure illustrates that we can increase or decrease each vector by the same number t, since the sum of three vectors so intro- duced is equal to zero. The point P can therefore be represented by coordi- nates m \u2212 t, n \u2212 t, \u2212t, in which t is any number, positive or negative. In par- ticular t may be chosen equal to (m + n)/3, such that the sum of the three coordinates u \u2032 = m \u2212 (m + n)/3, v \u2032 = n \u2212 (m + n)/3 and t =\u2212 (m + n)/3 be-", "page": 72}

During crystal growth, unit cells are added in all three dimensions, according to Ha \u00a8uy\u2019s pic- ture (Figure 3.3a). Some surfaces are more sta- ble and grow more slowly, and those faces be- come large and determine the exterior mor- phology. In other directions, crystals grow fast, resulting in small faces, such as the tips of a prism or a needle. As is illustrated in Fig- ure 3.22, lattice planes with simple Miller in- dices such as (100) and (110) contain a high density of lattice points per surface element and have large interplanar spacings. Such faces are most commonly observed on crystal poly- hedra. Victor Goldschmidt determined statisti- cally that lattice planes \u2019with indices ( h 1k1l1) and ( h2k2l2) are more common than those with indices ( h1 + h2, k1 + k2,l1 + l2).

The atomic coordinates x, y, z are given in fractions of a unit cell length and range be- tween 0 and <1. If a coordinate is 1, it is counted as belonging to the next unit cell and reset to 0. Atomic coordinates can be compli- cated fractions, as is the case for atom A in Figure 3.23.

{"text": "Chapter 4 Macroscopic symmetries: crystal morphology Introduction In the previous chapters we have become famil- iar with the extraordinary regularity of the in- ternal structure of crystals. The local balancing of bonding forces between atoms leads to a pe- riodic repetition of elementary units. We have seen that these unit cells and the corresponding lattice arrays are diagnostic for speci\ufb01c minerals and have classi\ufb01ed them according to their sym- metry. Symmetry emerged as a central feature of minerals and crystals. In Chapter 3, we rec- ognized seven crystal systems, ranging from the highest cubic symmetry to the lowest triclinic symmetry. In this chapter we will look at sym- metry more formally, particularly in view of the possible symmetries that are present in the ex- ternal morphology of crystals. A characteristic feature of crystals is \u2018\u2018di- rectionality\u2019\u2019: speci\ufb01c directions in crystals are inherently different, and these differences are implicit in the lattice structure. Take, for ex- ample, a cubic crystal of galena (Figure 4.1a,e): if we view it along a crystal axis (e.g. [100]), we observe a 4-fold symmetry (Figure 4.1b); if the crystal is viewed along a body diagonal (e.g. [111]), it displays 3-fold symmetry (Figure 4.1c); if the cube is viewed along the bisectrix of two faces (e.g. [110]), two different mirror planes are observed (Figure 4.1d). If the growth velocity were isotropic, or equal in all directions, crystals would occur as spheres. Instead they display a regular morphology with planar surfaces. The largest faces are indicative of directions in which the growth velocity is slowest. Other properties, such as the propagation of acoustic waves, thermal conductivity, or color, may also vary in different directions (Chapter 8). A material displaying directionality is called anisotropic. Only rarely, however, does either the internal structure or a macroscopic property of a crys- tal differ in all possible directions. Take again the cubic crystal of Figure 4.1. If the crystal viewed along [111] is turned 120 \u25e6, it is indistin- guishable from the original setting. If parts of a crystal are identical in different directions, we say that they are related by symmetry. Symme- try is fundamental to anisotropic crystals. In or- der to understand and visualize symmetry and anisotropy, we must \ufb01rst learn how to represent directional properties, which we do in the next section. Spherical representations of morphology Crystals are three-dimensional. So far we have represented crystal structures and lattices by per- spective sketches, but on these plots it is dif\ufb01cult to see detailed geometrical relationships. For ex- ample, what is the angle between a [100] direc- tion and a [111] direction in a cubic crystal? It would be useful to have a way to capture the quantitative geometrical relationships in crystals and allow us to measure geometrical features. A method that projects the crystal onto a sphere has proven to be very useful in this regard.", "page": 77}

(e) This is illustrated in an actual mineral sample with several crystals of galena from Tristate District, USA (40 mm \u00d7 67 mm) (courtesy O. Medenbach). The procedure is as follows: take a crystal with well-developed planar faces and place it in the center of a large sphere. In Figure 4.2a this is shown for a cubic crystal, with large cube faces of the type {100}, and smaller faces for an octahedron of the type {111} and dodecahe- dron of the type {110} (see Figure 4.17a). Then construct normals (perpendicular lines) to each face, going through the center of the sphere and intersecting the surface of the sphere. Each point of intersection is called a pole, and in Figure 4.2a Miller indices are assigned. Thus we can repre- sent crystal faces (or lattice planes) (hkl) by points on a spherical surface. In Figure 4.2b we have again a sphere and on it an arbitrary point P representing a pole to the shaded lattice plane (hkl). If we de\ufb01ne a coordinate system such as north and south poles (N and S), as well as an east-point E on the equator, then we can specify the point P by two spherical angular coordinates: a polar an- gle \u03c1 (55 \u25e6), measured from the north pole, and an azimuth \u03c6 (210\u25e6), measured from some ar- bitrary origin E (Figure 4.2b).

(b) A lattice plane (hkl) is translated through the center of the sphere. It intersects the sphere along a great circle (shown dashed). If we construct the normal to the lattice plane, it intersects the sphere at point P . The location of point P on the sphere is speci\ufb01ed by spherical coordinates, an azimuth \u03c6 and a polar angle \u03c1. The azimuth is measured counterclockwise from the E-point, while the polar angle is measured from the North Pole. (c) These coordinates are similar to geographical coordinates used to specify the location of a place on the earth. Geographical longitude corresponds to the azimuth and is measured from the Greenwich meridian; geographical latitude is measured from the equator, rather than from the pole.

New York, for exam- ple, has a latitude 41 \u25e6 north (corresponding to a polar angle of 49 \u25e6) and a longitude of 74 \u25e6 west.

In effect, we have projected the three-dimensional crystal structure onto a spherical surface. However, in order to achieve useful constructions, we need to project this spherical surface on to a plane. There are several standard methods for project- ing a spherical surface on to a plane. We describe here the two most important ones: stereographic projection is used mainly in crystallography and materials science; equal area projection is used in structural geology.

{"text": "58 MACROSCOPIC SYMMETRIES: CRYSTAL MORPHOLOGY stereographic projection is simple: the sphere\u2019s surface is viewed from the South Pole (point S) and point P 1 (at coordinates \u03c6 = 330\u25e6, \u03c1 = 60\u25e6) o nt h es p h e r ei sp r o j e c t e dt op o i n tP\u2032 1 on the equatorial plane where the line SP 1 intersects the equatorial plane (Figure 4.3a). The perspec- tive view of the sphere in Figure 4.3a illustrates the projection of a circle on the sphere passing through P 1 onto the equatorial plane. The exact geometrical relationships can be seen by look- ing at a section through the sphere that con- tains the meridian on which the point P 1,t h e South Pole (point S) and the North Pole (point N) lie (Figure 4.3b). If the radius of the sphere is R, the distance d = OP \u2032 1 is R tan (\u03c1/2). Points on the lower hemisphere (such as P2) project outside the equator (P \u2032 2), but such projections are gen- erally avoided. Instead the lower hemisphere is viewed from the North Pole, and the projection points (such as P \u2032\u2032 2 in Figure 4.3b) are assigned dif- ferent symbols (open circles) to distinguish them from upper hemisphere projections. We now con- struct a circle to represent the equatorial plane (Figure 4.3c), representing the shaded circle in Figure 4.3a. On it we mark the origin E (east point) for counting the azimuth (i.e., the pole of (010)). Then we measure the azimuth of P 1, for example \u03c6 = 330\u25e6 counterclockwise from E, and draw a line from N to P 0 1 in Figure 4.3c. The projection P \u2032 1 is plotted at a distance d = R tan (\u03c1/2) = 21 mm tan (30\u25e6) = 12.2m mf r o m the center (N). Some constructions with stereo- graphic projection are illustrated in Box 4.1. When we project a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional plane, some information is lost or distorted. For example, one characteris- tic of stereographic projections is that all circles on the sphere, including small circles, appear as circles in projection. Therefore all lines in a Wulff net are circles (Figure 4.4b). However, the geomet- rical center of a projected circle, when drawn with a compass, does not, in general, coincide with the projection point of the \u2018\u2018true\u201d center es- tablished on the sphere. As a further example of projection distortions, we note that, while equal angles between two directions have the same dis- tance in projection, whether close to the North Pole (center) or close to the equator (peripheral circle), equal areas do not. For example, a 10 \u25e6\u00d7 10\u25e6 segment is much smaller near the North Pole than near the equator (Figure 4.4b). This is a handicap for many applications and, therefore, another projection method was developed that we will discuss in the next section.

{"text": "as explained above, is simpli\ufb01ed if we use a template of a projected coordinate system, called a Wulff net, named after the Russian crystallographer George V. Wulff (1863\u20131925). Using the Wulff net we do not need a protractor or calculator to plot points. The Wulff net is a coordinate system on a sphere with circles of equal longitude (great circles) and circles of equal latitude (small circles) projected onto a plane by means of stereographic projection. However, rather than projecting it with the North Pole in the center (Figure 4.4a), the sphere is rotated so that the North Pole is on top (Figure 4.4b). This net represents an auxiliary coordinate system to perform constructions, not the actual coordinate system that is used for representing poles (with azimuth and polar angles). Circles are usually drawn in 2 \u25e6 intervals; Figure 4.4 shows them in 10\u25e6 intervals. The azimuth on this net should be numbered on the outer (primitive) circle, beginning at the bottom and advancing clockwise (Figure 4.4b shows these numbers from 0 to 35 in 10 \u25e6 increments). Also mark the E-point. Since these nets are used a great deal, it is customary to mount them on a piece of cardboard", "page": 81}

Angular intervals between circles are 10 \u25e6. (b) The same coordinate system, but rotated so that the North Pole is at the top. This projection of the coordinate system is called a Wulff net and used for constructions. Angular labels are applied to the outer circle. Note that numbering on this auxiliary net starts at the bottom and progresses clockwise, which produces a clockwise representation with the azimuth starting at the E-point, when plotted on tracing paper. (c) In practice, the Wulff net is usually mounted on a piece of cardboard and a thumbtack T is applied, so that a superimposed sheet of tracing paper can be rotated about the center. (Figure 4.4c). Constructions are not actually done on the net but on a sheet of tracing paper that is superposed on the net. By applying a thumbtack (T) from the back, the tracing paper can be rotated around the center of the Wulff net (Figure 4.4c). Alternatively you can pin down the paper with a sharp pencil point and spin it around the center. We introduce below the procedures of constructions using the Wulff net with three examples. 1. Plot a pole P 1 with spherical coordinates \u03c6 = 330\u25e6, \u03c1 = 60\u25e6 r Place a sheet of tracing paper over the Wulff net and mark the 0 \u25e6 azimuth and the center. r Rotate your tracing paper over the center of the \ufb01xed Wulff net (shown in light gray lines in Figure 4.5a) until your zero mark on the tracing paper is at 33 (i.e., 330 \u25e6). (All construction marks on the tracing paper are shown in black.) r Plot the projection of pole P 1 by measuring 60 \u25e6 on the radius from the center towards the E-point (on the Wulff net) (Figure 4.5a). The pole is perpendicular to a lattice plane (hkl ) and we can draw the intersection of that lattice plane (the so-called trace) with the sphere, assuming that the plane goes through the center of the sphere. The plane is perpendicular to the pole and the intersection is a great circle. We draw this great circle on the tracing paper (labeledhkl), measuring 90 \u25e6 from P1 on the horizontal diameter (Figure 4.5a). Try to visualize this plane, which is fairly steeply inclined to the equatorial plane.", "page": 82}
{"text": "60 MACROSCOPIC SYMMETRIES: CRYSTAL MORPHOLOGY r The labeling of the Wulff net appears contrary to our previous de\ufb01nition that the azimuth is counted from the E-point counterclockwise. However, this is only an auxiliary labeling, which you can verify by rotating the tracing paper back, until the zero mark coincides with the zero mark on the Wulff net (Figure 4.5b) and you realize that the azimuthal angle is indeed counted 330 \u25e6 counterclockwise from the E-point and the plot is identical with the one of point P1 done without the Wulff net (Figure 4.3c). r If \u03c1 is greater than 90 \u25e6 (e.g., pole P 2 \u03c6 = 70\u25e6, \u03c1 = 125\u25e6), the pole will correspond to a spherical point in the lower hemisphere, and when projected onto the equatorial plane it would plot outside the peripheral circle (Figure 4.3b). If we use a Wulff net that does not extend beyond the peripheral circle, we have two choices: we can plot the opposite end of the normal P opp 2 that re-enters at \u03c6 + 180\u25e6, \u03c1 = 180\u25e6 \u2212\u03c1 (i.e., at coordinates \u03c6 = 250\u25e6, \u03c1 = 55\u25e6) (Figure 4.5c). Alternatively we continue along the radius and re-enter the peripheral circle on the lower hemisphere (35 \u25e6) and plot P2, indicating with an open circle symbol that the pole is on the lower hemisphere. Some caution is advised: many constructions on the Wulff net cannot be done by simply combining poles on upper and lower hemispheres! 2. Determine the angle between two crystal faces P 1 and P3. The coordinates of the poles of these faces are \u03c6 = 330\u25e6, \u03c1 = 60\u25e6 for P1 and \u03c6 = 60\u25e6, \u03c1 = 80\u25e6 for P3. (The internal angle between two faces is the supplement of the angle between the poles.) r P1 and the trace of the face (h1k1l1) are already plotted. We plot P3 and the trace (h3k3l3) the same way from its \u03c6 and \u03c1 values. r We now rotate the tracing paper above the Wulff net until both poles, P 1 and P3, lie on a great circle (Figure 4.5d). (The zero arrow on the tracing paper lies over the 35 = 350\u25e6 mark on the Wulff net.) We can read the angular distance between the two points by counting the divisions on the great circle. In this case the angle between the poles is 87 \u25e6, therefore the angle between the two faces is 93\u25e6. 3. We now return to the cubic crystal of Figure 4.2a with poles on faces (100), (110), (111), etc., and want to plot them in stereographic projection. We also would like to determine the angle between (001) and (111), and between (111) and (1 \u00af11) r The plane (001) is parallel tox and y and, for crystals belonging to the cubic system, the pole is parallel to z and has spherical coordinates \u03c6 = 0\u25e6, \u03c1 = 0\u25e6; similarly (110) has spherical coordinates \u03c6 = 45\u25e6, \u03c1 = 90\u25e6. These two poles", "page": 83}
{"text": "are easily plotted (Figure 4.5e). r Coordinates of (111) are more dif\ufb01cult to establish. We could do this with trigonometry (Figure 3.18) but it is easier to apply zonal relationships and construct its position. On the crystal in Figure 4.2a we see that faces (001), (111), and (110) are cozonal, i.e., they share the common direction [1 \u00af10]. (Try to calculate the zone from pairs of faces according to the (hkl)\u2013[uvw] cross-multiplication rule in Chapter 3.) The poles therefore lie on the same great circle (zone circle), perpendicular to [1 \u00af10]. Face (111) is also cozonal with (010) and (101), with a zone circle perpendicular to [\u00af101]. It is therefore at the intersection of the two zone circles. Coordinates of [1 \u00af10] are \u03c6 = 225 \u25e6, \u03c1 = 90\u25e6 and of [\u00af101] are \u03c6 = 90\u25e6, \u03c1 = 45\u25e6.", "page": 83}
{"text": "SPHERICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF MORPHOLOGY 61 r We plot [1\u00af10] and [ \u00af101] and construct for each point the great circle per- pendicular to it, using the Wulff net and plotting its trace. The zone circle perpendicular to [1 \u00af10] is vertical and the trace is therefore a straight line. The zone circle perpendicular to [ \u00af101] is inclined and we have to use the Wulff net to plot its trace (Figure 4.5e). The pole of (111) is obtained as the intersection of the two zone circles. r Next we rotate the tracing paper back into its starting position (Figure 4.5f) and can read off the spherical coordinates of (111) as: \u03c6 = 325 \u25e6, \u03c1 = 53\u25e6. Also, we can complete adding all other poles of the crystal in Figure 4.2a by symmetry (Figure 4.2d). (1 \u00af11) is shown in Figure 4.5f. r Finally we need to determine the angles between poles (001) and (111), and (111) and (1 \u00af11). This is done by rotating the tracing paper to bring pairs on a great circle of the Wulff net. For example in Figure 4.5e we can read the interfacial angle between (111) and (1\u00af11) as 64 \u25e6. (Note that in this construction the interfacial angle is de\ufb01ned as the angle between the two poles.) Similarly the angle between (001) and (111) poles is determined as 53 \u25e6. r We have established a relationship between lattice plane poles (hkl) and zones [uvw]. In Figure 4.5e, the intersection of two zone circles (solid lines) z[110] and z[\u00af101] determines the pole (111). In Figure 4.5f we have drawn the traces of planes (111) and (1 \u00af11) (dashed lines) and their intersection determines the zone axis [ \u00af101]. This construction, as well as the corresponding cross- multiplication rule, applies to all crystal symmetries. However, for example for triclinic symmetry, the pole to (001) and the direction [001] do not coincide! Equal-area projection The stereographic projection is commonly used when angular relationships are important. For other applications, however, the equal-area pro- jection is preferred. This latter method works as follows: using again the meridian section that contains the direction P of interest, we \ufb01nd this time the projection P \u2032 by rotating P around the North Pole N onto a horizontal plane through the North Pole (Figure 4.6a). The distance NP is identical with the distance NP \u2032 and, by apply- ing trigonometry to the right triangle SNP (Fig- ure 4.6a), we \ufb01nd NP = 2R sin (\u03c1/ 2), where R is the radius of the sphere. Point E on the equator projects as E \u2032 with a distance r = NE\u2032 = \u221a2R. Contrary to stereographic projection, the radius of the equatorial circle is not the same as the ra- dius of the sphere and values for distances NP \u2032 need to be renormalized accordingly. As with the stereographic projection method, points on the lower hemisphere project outside the equa- tor. The South Pole would project as a circle at a distance 2 R.", "page": 84}
{"text": "(In the stereographic projection method, the South Pole would project into in\ufb01n- ity.) As was the case in the stereographic projec- tion method, poles on the lower hemisphere are generally projected by rotating around the South Pole, instead of the North Pole, and marked with different symbols (open circles), so that all poles are inside the equatorial circle (peripheral circle). An auxiliary net for equal-area constructions is also available. It is called the equal-area or Schmidt net named after the structural geologist Walter Schmidt (Figure 4.6b) and can be used in a manner analogous to that of the Wulff net (Fig- ure 4.4b). All the constructions illustrated in Box 4.1 can be done the same way with a Schmidt net. The only difference between the two methods is the distance of a pole from the center. For equal- area projection, corresponding poles are closer", "page": 84}

Unlike stereographic projection, however, in equal-area projection, apart from the peripheral circle, neither great circles nor small circles on the sphere appear as circles in projection and cannot be drawn with a compass. An angle on the Schmidt net is larger in the center than at the periphery, but the areas of regions with iden- tical angular dimensions are equal.

Typical applications of equal-area projection occur in structural geology, where strikes and dips of foliation or bedding planes, as well as bearings and plunges of fold axes, are plotted.

It is important to be able to visualize the three-dimensionality of a spherical projection and intuitively to see points in projection as di- rections in space. This visualization skill takes some practice, and the easiest way to become comfortable with such projections is by using the analogy to geographical representations of the earth (Figure 4.2c). In these circular diagrams, al- ways visualize a sphere extending over the circle. Point-group symmetry Stereographic projection and symmetry In the previous section we discussed how to repre- sent three-dimensional crystal directions and lat- tice planes by two-dimensional projections and applied these techniques to a cubic crystal. Note that in making such a projection, we lose in- formation concerning the size of faces and the l e n g t ho fe d g e so fac r y s t a l .A sw eh a v es e e np r e - viously (see Figure 3.1), the size of faces can vary greatly, yet interfacial angles are strictly constant as stated in Steno\u2019slaw of constancy of interfacial an- gles. Therefore, a spherical method is an ideal way to assess the geometry of a crystal. The crystal morphology can be displayed as a perspective drawing (Figure 4.2a) such as that of a \ufb02uorite crystal with a combination of cubic (e.g., 100), octahedral (e.g., 111), and dodecahedral (e.g., 110) faces. This method of display is ineffec- tive, however, when it comes to an assessment of angular relationships. Instead, stereographic pro- jection can be used and we have illustrated this in the previous section. For the complicated per- spective drawing in Figure 4.2a we obtain a highly symmetrical pattern in projection (Figure 4.2d). With the help of a Wulff net, we can determine all interfacial angles. We can also plot symmetry elements on a stereogram, including rotation axes and mirror planes. For example, Figure 4.8a illustrates, by means of a perspective drawing, the rotation axes that are present in a cubic crystal.

Miller indices change during this rotation and we obtain from (hkl) (1), ( \u00afkhl ) (2), ( \u00afh\u00afkl) (3), and (k \u00afhl) (4).

Again, during this rotation, the poles follow small circle paths (dashed lines), which we can verify with the Wulff net (Fig- ure 4.4b). Lastly we apply the a 2 rotation to all 16 poles (Figure 4.9c). Doing this, we note that the new positions of many poles coincide with", "page": 88}

On this pole pattern (Figure 4.9c and sum- marized in Figure 4.8b) we notice that 3-fold ro- tations and 2-fold rotations are already implicit and do not generate new poles, i.e., we did not need them to generate the 24 poles. The 24 poles represent a polyhedron that is typical of this combination of rotation axes (Figure 4.8c). Crys- tallographers call this particular polyhedron a pentagon-trioctahedron, which resembles an oc- tahedron, but with each triangular face of the octahedron divided into three pentagons. Such ap o l y h e d r o ni nw h i c ha l lf a c e sa r er e l a t e db y symmetry is called a crystal form. Each face of a form has a Miller index \u2018\u2018 hkl\u2019\u2019 with the numerical values being permutations of h, k,a n d l, both positive and negative, as shown in Figure 4.9. All poles on the lower hemisphere have a negative l. We give the collection of all (hkl)s produced by symmetry the symbol {hkl}. Note that (hkl)i st h e symbol for a particular face, whereas {hkl} is the symbol for all faces of a form. Similarly, crystal directions [uvw] are multiplied by symmetry, and to express the whole set of symmetrically equiv- alent directions we use the symbol \u27e8uvw\u27e9. Thus the symbol \u27e8100\u27e9 for a cubic crystal implies [100], [010], [001], [\u00af100], [0\u00af10], and [00 \u00af1]. Symmetry operations revisited We have already touched upon symmetry consid- erations in Chapter 3, where we introduced three symmetry operations: translation, rotation, and mirror re\ufb02ection. We now discuss these opera- tions in more detail. Translation is the most basic symmetry opera- tion present in all crystals owing to their periodic lattice structure (see Figure 3.5b). Yet translation is not expressed directly in the symmetry of the external forms because the translation distances a r ev e r ys m a l l( o nt h eo r d e ro faf e w\u02daangstr\u00a8oms) and cannot be seen directly. We have noted ear- lier, however, that translational symmetry (i.e., the lattice character of crystals) imposes limita- tions on the types of rotation axes that are ex- pressed in the external crystal forms. Thus we will exclude translation from the discussion of symmetries of crystal forms for now, but return to it at the end of this chapter. Rotations and mirror re\ufb02ections are expressed in crystal forms. A cubic crystal, for example, has quite a large number of symmetry elements, whereas a triclinic crystal has very few. There are a limited number of possible combinations of ro- tations and mirror re\ufb02ections in crystals. In 1830, Johann F.C. Hessell determined that there are only 32 different such combinations, and these combinations are now called symmetry classes or point-groups. To each such combination a symbol is assigned. Physicists commonly use the older", "page": 89}

Both symbol systems are listed in Table 4.1. We will now ex- plore possible point-group symmetries, without going through a rigorous derivation. (Those in- terested in a more systematic discussion should consult Buerger, 1978, pp. 23--68.) By means of rotation (Hermann--Mauguin sym- bol n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) around an n-fold symme- try axis, a crystal comes to coincidence after an angular rotation of \u03c6 = 360 \u25e6/n.A f t e rnsuch ro- tations the crystal is again in the starting posi- tion. Only 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotation axes can occur in crystals (as noted in Chapter 3, the lat- tice structure of crystals does not allow for axes with n = 5, 7, 8, or higher). The 1-fold rotation is trivial, because every object is brought to co- incidence after a 360 \u25e6 rotation. Rotation axes are indicated by symbols on stereoplots, as we have done in Figure 4.8b for a cubic crystal. In Figure 4.10a we take a simple case with a single 2-fold rotation axis that generates two identical motifs (e.g., the number 5). After applying the 2-fold ro- tation two times we return to the starting point. A mirror reflection (symbol m) produces a mir- ror image, and the operation needs to be applied twice to reproduce the original object. A mirror plane is indicated by a solid line (great circle) in a stereoplot (Figure 4.10b). Recall that a mirror re\ufb02ection does not produce an identical repeti- tion of an object, but rather an enantiomorphic repetition, creating a left-handed object from a right-handed object (Figure 3.5d). There is a fourth symmetry operation called inversion (symbol i), and the corresponding sym- metry element is called an inversion center, indi- cated by a small open circle in the center of the", "page": 89}

Closed circles are on the upper hemisphere; open circles are on the lower hemisphere. stereoplot. In Figure 4.10c (top) a motif on the upper hemisphere is transformed into a motif on the lower hemisphere by an inversion in the center of the sphere. As with mirror re\ufb02ection, the inversion operation produces a mirror image and a change of handedness of the object. Many crystal structures possess one or more inversion centers, i.e., points in the unit cell from which all atoms have equivalents at the opposite end. (For example, in the structure of halite (Figure 3.24b), one inversion center is in the corner of the unit cell.) This internal inversion also applies to the external morphology, with crystal faces inverted on opposite ends of the inversion center. In the bottom row of Figure 4.10 we have re- placed the number 5 motif by a point, or pole, and we will use this representation in the discus- sion that follows. Be aware, however, that poles do not tell us directly whether the symmetry operation changes the handedness. Remember that translations and rotations keep the hand- edness, while mirror re\ufb02ections and inversions change the handedness. Symmetry operations can also be combined. We have already seen in Figure 4.8a an example of a cubic crystal with three 4-fold, four 3-fold, and six 2-fold axes. Let us now look at a simple combination of a 2-fold rotation and an inversion (Figure 4.10d). In Figure 4.10d (top) we apply the two operations in consecutive steps: \ufb01rst we ro- tate the number 5 around the 2-fold axis (which we have put into the equatorial plane) and ob- tain a 5 on the lower hemisphere after a 180 \u25e6 rotation. We then invert the number 5 and ob- tain a \ufb01nal 5 with changed handedness on the upper hemisphere. Particularly in the representa- tion with poles, and leaving out the intermediate step (Figure 4.10d, bottom), we recognize a mirror plane perpendicular to the 2-fold axis. This is the same as the pattern in Figure 4.10b, bottom, illus- trating that a 2-fold rotation--inversion is equiva- lent to a mirror plane perpendicular to the 2-fold axis. Thus we do not need to consider both mir- ror re\ufb02ection and inversion in the derivation of possible combinations of symmetry elements in crystals. We have combined (in Figure 4.10d) a 2-fold ro- tation", "page": 91}

Some rotoinversion axes produce mirror planes perpendicular to the rotation axis, as in the case of the 2-fold rotoin- version, others do not. Rotation axes are called proper if they are simple rotations and improper if they are rotoinversions. Thirty-two point-groups The 32 point-groups are simply combinations of these symmetry elements, and the different pos- sibilities are best explored with stereoplots. First, we consider point groups with a single rotation axis, the so-called monaxial point-groups that are illustrated in the \ufb01rst three rows of Figure 4.11, except for the last column to which we will re- turn later. If the rotation axis is proper, there are \ufb01ve possible groups, with Hermann--Mauguin symbols 1 (no symmetry), 2, 3, 4, and 6. Stereo- plots for these \ufb01ve groups (top row of Figure 4.11) display rotation axes and repetitions of a general pole, i.e., a pole to a lattice plane (hkl) that is in no special position relative to the symmetry ele- ments, as with that illustrated in Figure 4.8. Next w eh a v et h eg r o u p sw i t has i n g l ei m p r o p e ra x i s\u00afn, i.e., a combined rotation and inversion. There are again \ufb01ve such groups (\u00af1, \u00af2, \u00af3, \u00af4, \u00af6). The Wulff net can be used to construct the pattern for repeti- tions of a general pole, illustrated in the second row of Figure 4.11. Group \u00af2 is generally shown as m because, as we have seen, a mirror plane is equivalent to a 2-fold improper rotation. Simi- larly, group \u00af6i se q u i v a l e n tt o3 /m, where the sym- bol \u2018\u2018/m \u2019 \u2019d e n o t e st h a tam i r r o rp l a n ei sp e r p e n - dicular to the rotation axis. Proper and improper rotations may be combined (general symbol n/\u00afn). These groups are displayed in the third row of Figure 4.11. With combined proper--improper ro- tations we apply \ufb01rst the proper rotation to a pole and then the improper rotation to all poles that have been generated. The results illustrate that not all the patterns are new. For example 1/\u00af1 = \u00af1a n d3 /\u00af3 = \u00af3. Verify this by performing all the symmetry operations. In the remaining cases, with even-fold rotation axes we produce a pattern with a mirror plane m perpendicular to the rotation axis, and the symbols are 2/ m (for 2/\u00af2), 4/ m (for 4/ \u00af4) and 6/ m (for 6/ \u00af6). In total, there are 13 monaxial point groups with a single rotation axis. A crystal may contain rotation axes in differ- ent directions, de\ufb01ning the polyaxial point-groups. Again, the lattice imposes restrictions on the di- rections in which axes may be present. If there is more than one axis, there have", "page": 92}

The general symbol for a polyaxial point- group is n 1 n2 n3. The simplest case is 222 in the orthorhombic system with three 2-fold axes at right angles to each other (Figure 4.13a). Next is 322, generally abbreviated to 32, with a 3-fold axis and two 2-fold axes perpendicular to it at an an- gle of 60 \u25e6 to each other (Figure 4.13b). (The third 2-fold axis in the stereoplot of Figure 4.13b is pro- duced by the 3-fold rotation axis.) Point-group 422 has two types of 2-fold axes at 90 \u25e6 to the 4-fold axis and an angle of 45 \u25e6 between them (Figure 4.13c). (Again the 4-fold rotation produces addi- tional symmetrical 2-fold axes.) In these tetrago- nal crystals the two types of 2-fold axes are \u27e8100\u27e9 and \u27e8110\u27e9. Point-group 622 has two types of 2- fold axes at 90 \u25e6 to the 6-fold axis and an angle of 30\u25e6 between them (Figure 4.13d). In these hexago- nal crystals the two types of 2-fold axes are along a =\u27e8 2\u00af1\u00af10\u27e9 and \u27e810\u00af10\u27e9. In the cubic system there are two types of polyaxial groups with axes along \u27e8100\u27e9, \u27e8111\u27e9, and \u27e8110\u27e9 of the cube (Figure 4.13e,f). In the \ufb01rst type, 233 (or simply 23, and not to be confused with the trigonal point-group 32), a 2-fold axes is along \u27e8100\u27e9 and corresponding 3-fold axes are \u27e8111\u27e9 and \u27e81\u00af11\u27e9 (Figure 4.13e).

This is the case we have already explored earlier (see Figures 4.8 and 4.9). Thus there are six polyaxial groups with only proper rotations (also shown in the fourth row of Figure 4.11). As with monaxial groups, polyaxial groups can also have proper (P) and improper (I) rota- tions; however, after applying three rotations, identity must result.

Review the stereoplots in Figure 4.11 and con\ufb01rm how poles are repeated by symmetry operations. Hermann--Mauguin symbols, as introduced above, are relatively easy to read, particularly in an unabbreviated form. The general symbol is n 1/\u00afn1 n2/\u00afn2 n3/\u00afn3 and stands for three n-fold axes in different directions. All other rotation axes that may be present in the crystal are symmetri- cally equivalent to one of these three axes.

The symbol 2mm d e n o t e st h a tt w om i r r o rp l a n e sa r ep a r a l l e l to a 2-fold axis, etc. The full symbol is often abbreviated; for exam- ple, instead of 4/ m 2/m 2/m one writes 4/ mmm because not all symmetry operations are neces- sary to produce all repetitions. This means that with the symmetry elements in the abbreviated symbol we can generate all additional symme- try elements. We have seen how a general pole is multiplied through symmetry operations (e.g., in Figure 4.9). This multiplicity is also indicated in Table 4.1 and ranges from 1 (in 1) to 48 in m \u00af3 m. Of the 32 point-groups, 11 have only proper rotations, without mirror planes or an in- version center. As we will see in Chapter 8, some physical properties, such as optical activ- ity, are observed only in crystals from these enan- tiomorphic point-groups. Also, there are 11 point- g r o u p sw i t hac e n t e ro fs y m m e t r y( i n d i c a t e d by superscript a in the multiplicity column). In centrosymmetrical point groups there is for every crystal face (hkl) or crystal direction [ uvw] an equivalent face ( \u00afh\u00afk\u00afl) and an equivalent direc- tion [\u00afu\u00afv \u00afw]. Crystallographic forms The symmetry of a crystal is expressed in its morphology. In Figure 4.11, symmetry operations generated a set of poles. Each of these poles is representative of a lattice plane or a crystal face, and the collection of poles represents a polyhedron or form. In some cases this \u2018\u2018crystal- lographic polyhedron\u2019\u2019 is not a usual geometrical polyhedron for which the whole surface is covered with faces. The form {hkl}, for example {123}, in point-group 1 is a single plane. There is no symmetry operation that generates an equivalent face. In other cases the form is a normal polyhedron, such as {123} in point-group 432, which is a pentagon-trioctahedron with 24 faces (Figure 4.8c). If the faces of a form do not cover the whole surface, we call it an open form, contrary to a regular closed form. For open forms, several forms have to be combined to cover the whole surface of a crystal. In the case of point-group 1, a combination of {100}, {010}, {001}, {\u00af100}, {0\u00af10}, {00\u00af1}, each consisting of a single face, would cover the surface. Every point-group has a characteristic form, and Figure 4.14 illustrates, in perspective draw- ings, all the forms corresponding to the poles in Figure 4.11. These forms are called general forms, because they consist of faces with no special re- lationship, either to crystallographic axes or to the symmetry elements (rotation axes and mirror planes). They have indices {hkl} with h, k,a n d l representing arbitrary numbers without relation- ship (e.g., {125}).", "page": 96}
{"text": "Try to relate the forms and faces in Figure 4.14 to the stereoplots in Figure 4.11. Special forms, on the other hand, have special re- lations to crystallographic axes and symmetry elements and are therefore repeated less often than the faces in the general form. Miller indices are related (e.g., {111}) or special numbers (e.g., {100}). We illustrate this for point-group 4/ m 2/m 2/m (Figure 4.15). The general form {hkl} has eight poles on the upper hemisphere and eight poles on the lower hemisphere (Figure 4.15a). This corresponds to a pyramid with eight faces on top and eight on the bottom, and crystallogra- phers call it a ditetragonal bipyramid.I ti sc a l l e da bipyramid because it has a top and a bottom, and it is called ditetragonal because the 4-fold sym- metry is split into eight faces by mirror planes. Symmetrically equivalent (hkl)s are labeled in Fig- ure 4.15a. There are several special forms (Figure 4.1 5b). If the pole is at (001), it is not repeated by the 4-fold rotation. The only symmetry operation that generates an additional pole is the mirror plane perpendicular to the 4-fold axis, produc- ing (00 \u00af1). Thus the form {001} consists of only two poles, corresponding to two parallel faces, called a pinacoid. If the pole lies on a mirror plane with Miller indices ( h0 l )o r(hhl), the correspond- i n gf o r mi satetragonal bipyramid with only four faces on the top and on the bottom. If the pole lies on the equator, it represents a face parallel to the z-axis and the Miller index l is zero.

On top are perspective drawings of forms, below it corresponding stereograms in which Miller indices of poles are marked. multiplicity of special forms is lower than that of the general form, since poles that lie on a rotation axis or on a mirror plane are not re- peated by the symmetry operation. Each symme- try class (except triclinic) can have a variety of forms, depending upon the relationship between the orientations of lattice planes and symmetry elements. While the general form is unique for a point-group, a general form in one point-group may be a special form in another. For example, we have seen that a tetragonal bipyramid is a special form in 4/ m 2/m 2/m, but it is a general form in 4 /m. Also, depending on the point-group, a form with the same Miller indices may be a closed poly- hedron, such as a bipyramid {hkl} in point-group 4/m (Figure 4.16a), or may be open on one side, such as a pyramid {hkl} in point-group 4 (Figure 4.16b). The surface of a freely growing crystal may consist of a single form, such as {110} in cubic garnet (Figure 4.17a) and {210} in pyrite (Figure 4.17b), or may represent a combination of forms, (a) (b) Fig. 4.16 The form {hkl} can be (a) a tetragonal bipyramid (closed form) in point-group 4/m, or (b) a tetragonal pyramid (open form) in point-group 4.", "page": 99}

A great many forms are possible in the 32 classes. Some of them are unique to a particular system or class, but the commonest forms occur in several classes. Therefore, while recog- nizing forms on a crystal is helpful in identifying the crystal\u2019s symmetry, it often is not suf\ufb01cient. For example, the cube {100} is a form that ex- ists in all \ufb01ve cubic point-groups. At one time students on mineralogy courses were frequently required to memorize the names of all the crys- tal forms, but such memorization is considered to be less important today. Nevertheless everyone should be familiar with the names of the com- monest polyhedra and be able to decipher their symmetry (Box 4.2). The best-known polyhedra are the \ufb01ve reg- ular polyhedra (also known as Platonic solids) with indistinguishable faces, edges, and corners (Table 4.2, Figure 4.18). The faces are simple regular polygons, i.e., triangles, squares, and pentagons. As is the case for all other poly- hedra, Leonhard Euler\u2019s theorem, which relates the number of faces ( f ), corners (c ), and edges (e), applies: c + f = e + 2. Note, however, that only cubic {100}, octahedral {111} and tetrahe- dral {111} forms are present in crystals. This situation arises because dodecahedra and icosa- hedra imply the presence of 5-fold rotation", "page": 100}

However, contrary to the Platonic pentagon-dodecahedron, the pyrite pentagon-dodecahedron is not regular: a closer look reveals that one side of each pen- tagon face is longer than the others. Prisms are forms consisting of a group of co- zonal faces (with poles lying on a great circle) repeated to form an open-ended tube. Prisms can be produced by a variety of symmetry operations, including the combination 2/ m (Figure 4.19a), but the commonest types of prism (Figure 4.19b) are generated by a repetition of a face that is parallel to a rotation axis by a 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold rotation (trigonal, tetragonal, and hexag- onal prisms, respectively). Pyramids are a group of faces inclined to a rotation axis. Figure 4.19c, for example, illustrates a trigonal pyramid with a 3-fold rotation axis. If there is a mirror plane per- pendicular to the rotation axis, a pyramid on top is repeated at the bottom (bipyramid in Figure 4.19d). An interesting form is the rhombohedron (Figure 4.19e), in which a trigonal pyramid on top is repeated at the bottom not by a mirror plane, but rather by an inversion.

An important open form is the base with Miller indices (001) or (0001) in the hexagonal system. It consists of a single plane also known as basal plane. Some comments on space-groups The 32 point-groups describe the symmetry of the external crystal morphology as combinations of rotations, mirror re\ufb02ections, and inversions. At the atomic level another symmetry opera- tion, translation, is signi\ufb01cant. Translation has already been introduced as the basic principle of the lattice: every atom repeats after a unit cell translation along each of the three crys- tallographic axes. The German mathematician Artur Schoen\ufb02ies (1891) and the Russian min- eralogist Ephgraph S. von Fedorow (1885) deter- mined independently that there can be only 230 different combinations of rotation, mirror re\ufb02ec- tion, inversion, and translation in crystals with a lattice structure. These combinations are called space-groups. The structure of any crystal belongs to one of these 230 groups. Interestingly, the derivation of possible structural symmetries oc- curred 25 years before the discovery of X-ray diffraction, which con\ufb01rmed that crystals had in- deed a lattice structure. We do not review space- groups in any depth here and just introduce a few characteristic features with an example. Anyone interested in details of space-groups and their symmetry elements should consult the Interna- tional Tables for Crystallography, Volume A (Hahn, 1987, 1988). Translation may be combined with rota- tion and mirror re\ufb02ection. Take, for example, the structure of the tetragonal mineral anatase (TiO 2),in which six oxygen atoms in octahedral coordination surround titanium. Some of the ti- tanium atoms de\ufb01ne the corners of the unit cell (Figure 4.20a). For simplicity only the coordina- tion octahedra are shown. We recognize two mir- r o rp l a n e sp a r a l l e lt ot h ez-axis, which are labeled m in Figure 4.20b (a pair of symmetrically equiva- lent octahedra is highlighted by darker shading). Also obvious in the anatase structure is a \u00af4r o - toinversion axis parallel to the z-axis that goes through the center of the unit cell (Figure 4.20c). Again a set of symmetrically equivalent octahe- dra is indicated by shading.

This produces a screw- like repetition as indicated for one octahedron in the structure with darker shading (Figure 4.20e) and the assembly of symmetrically equivalent octahedra is shown separately in Figure 4.20f to highlight the screw character. Such an axis that combines rotation with translation is called a screw axis. The symbol used to represent this axis is 4 1 to distinguish it from the pure rota- tion axis 4. The subscript 1 indicates a transla- tion of one quarter of the unit cell dimension in the direction of the rotation axis. A 4-fold screw axis with a translation of half the unit cell, not present in anatase, would have a sym- bol 4 2. After four of the tetragonal rotations-- translations, we are back at the start (i.e., at the identical point of the next unit cell).

{"text": "Chapter 5 Crystal growth and aggregation Nucleation of crystals Crystals have extraordinary properties of inter- nal structure and external morphology. In sev- eral chapters, we have described these features in detail, with emphasis on symmetry. In this chap- ter we will take a broader look at how minerals f o r ma n dh o wt h e yp r e s e n tt h e m s e l v e si nr o c k s . Unfortunately, most of the time, we do not ob- serve ideal symmetrical polyhedra, as described in Chapter 4. Crystal nucleation and growth generally begin when the concentrations of the elements in a crystal reach a certain level of supersatu- ration. This level can be reached by evaporation of a solvent as, for example, water in desert lakes and marine lagoons, with crystallization of evaporite minerals such as halite, sylvite, and gypsum. A temperature decrease may also initi- ate crystallization: examples are ice from liquid water and igneous minerals in cooling magmas. Pressure changes can cause spontaneous crystal- lization. For example, chalcedony, a \ufb01ne-grained v a r i e t yo fq u a r t z ,i sk n o w nt oh a v ef o r m e di n some tungsten deposits of northeastern Siberia under the rapid release of pressure. Finally, crystallization may be initiated by chemical reactions. An example is metamorphic schist that forms when mudstone, composed of clays, recrystallizes at elevated temperatures and pressures and new minerals form, such as mica, feldspar, quartz, and garnet. The crystallization of minerals in vol- canic lavas frequently occurs homogeneously throughout the lava volume. By contrast, crystal nucleation may occur on substrates of various kinds. A new mineral overgrows only particular faces and edges of the substrate crystal, often with a strict orientation relationship, based on similarities in the crystal structure (e.g. quartz, Figure 5.1a). Newly formed minerals may share a lattice plane and, if the structures of the face in substrate and nucleating crystal have some simi- larities, the substrate face is used as a template. Such minerals are said to be in an epitaxial re- lationship. Epitaxy is of great industrial impor- tance, for example in the manufacturing of thin crystal \ufb01lms with favorable orientations. High- temperature superconducting oxides are dif\ufb01cult to grow as single crystals, but they readily precip- itate on crystals of corundum (sapphire), because of the similarity in structure. In other cases orientated growth is not con- trolled by the structure of the substrate but rather by the orientation relative to the surface, with selected growth in the fastest direction per- pendicular to the surface. Such a relationship is called topotaxy. For example, feldspars in \ufb01ssure veins are often oriented with the [010] direction more or less normal to the contact surface (Figure 5.1b), and quartz crystals in \ufb01ssures usually grow with c-axes perpendicular to the free surface. A special type of crystal nucleation is re- lated to microorganisms. One example is the", "page": 107}

If crystals display perfect polyhedral surfaces with regular and characteristic interfacial angles, they are called euhedral, as opposed to crystals with irregular surfaces, as in most rocks, which are called anhedral. Euhedral growth occurs not only if there is free space, such as in a solution or a melt (the latter type of crystals is referred to as phenocrysts), but also in metamorphic rocks, where euhedral crystals with recognizable crys- tal faces can grow by replacing pre-existing min- erals. Garnets, staurolite, and amphiboles are ex- amples, and such euhedral crystals in metamor- phic rocks are called porphyroblasts. Sometimes crystals grow as ideal homoge- neous single crystals to a macroscopic size, and the external morphology is characterized by particular crystal forms. This is rather ex- ceptional, and more frequently intergrowths of crystals are observed. The morphology and state of aggregation depends on nucleation rate, the number of nucleation sites and on the growth rate. All of these are complicated functions of many parameters, including temperature, chem- ical composition, trace amounts, and defects in the crystal structure, and in most cases relation- ships are not very well known. Many different types of intergrowth of min- erals occur in rocks, and are representative of the conditions of formation. These so-called pet- rographic textures are the subject of petrography and are not addressed here. Instead we look at a few examples of mineral morphology and the underlying processes of formation. Habit The external appearance of a crystal, its com- bination of crystal forms, and the relative development of these forms are collectively called the crystal habit. Even though the com- plexities of crystal growth processes lead to morphologies that are not perfect regular polyhedra, there is nevertheless a characteristic shape to many minerals and it is used in mineral identi\ufb01cation (see Chapter 15). There are several terms to describe this appearance. Crystals can be equiaxed or equant (similarly developed in all three dimensions; Figures 5.2a--c). This can be in the cubic system such as pyrite (Figure 5.2a), or sphalerite (Figure 5.2b), but equiaxed crystals also exist in other systems such as trigonal hematite (Figure 5.2c). Crystals can be elongated if one dimension dominates (Figures 5.2d--g), or flattened if one dimension is suppressed (Figures 5.2h--j). Columnar, prismatic, acicular, fibrous and hair-like are terms used to distinguish different elongated crystal types, depending on how much one-dimensional growth dominates.

The same mineral may occur with an equant, acicular or \ufb01brous habit, depending upon the conditions under which it grows. An example is hematite that can be equant (Figure 5.2c),", "page": 108}

Different shadings are applied to equivalent forms. The qualitative terms that describe the habit have been used in assigning names to many minerals, often in a Greek translation. For exam- ple, scapolite (an aluminosilicate) has obtained its name due to its prismatic habit after the Greek /H9268/H9260/H9251/H9266/H9265\u03c2(skapos, meaning pillar), acmite (a variety of pyroxene) has been named accord- ing to its acicular shape after the Greek \u201a /H9251/H9260/H9262\u00b4/H9257 (acme, meaning spike), and sanidine (one of the feldspars) re\ufb02ects its tabular crystal habit (after the Greek word for \u2018\u2018plate\u201d). Sometimes it is possible to recognize indi- vidual forms.

Calcite may dis- play a rhombohedron {10\u00af14} (Figure 5.4a) or a combination of the form {21\u00af34}, a so-called scalenohedron, and the rhombohedron {10\u00af14} (Figure 5.4b). Sometimes calcite develops a prism {10\u00af10}, capped by a rhombohedron {01\u00af18} (Figure 5.4c). Quartz is almost always prismatic, with a prism {10\u00af10}, a large positive rhombohe- dron {10\u00af11} and a smaller negative rhombohe- dron {01\u00af11} (Figure 4.17c). If growth velocities in a crystal remain con- stant, then the original morphology is preserved. However, growth velocities may change during the growth history. For example, in Figure 5.5a t h eg r o w t ho nf a c e sp and s has become slower than on face m and the former two faces begin to dominate. In Figure 5.5b, on the other hand, the growth on m is slower than on p and s,a n di n this case faces p and s disappear. The faces of any crystallographic form ad- sorb material from the surroundings in a speci\ufb01c manner. Different faces incorporate isomorphic substitutions with unequal effectiveness. In a macroscopic crystal, this process leads to what is known as zoning. In thin sections the struc- tures look like sectors with different composi- tion, a phenomenon called sector zoning. A well- known example is bicolored tourmaline from Brazil or Madagascar, with the color re\ufb02ecting the Mn:Fe ratio (Plate 5c). In the colored quartz variety ametrine from Bolivia, sectors parallel to the negative rhombohedron {01\u00af11} are iron- richer yellow citrine, and sectors parallel to the positive rhombohedron {10\u00af11} are iron-poorer purple amethyst (Plate 5d). In tourmaline as well as ametrine the composition varies by only trace amounts but the visual effect is clear. An extreme case of sector zoning is observed in tetragonal sulfate crystals sublimated from the fumaroles of the volcanoes of the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia). The {100} pyramids have a composition KC u6FeBi(SO4)5O4Cl, corresponding to the min- eral atlasovite, while the {110} pyramids have a composition KCu7Fe(SO4)5O4Cl, corresponding to the mineral nabokoite. Sector zoning highlights the ambiguity of chemical composition, even of a single crystal growing in thermodynamic equi- librium. Another consideration in sector zoning is that the relative sizes of the sectors depend on the relative growth velocities of the faces, as is illus- trated schematically for \ufb02uorite (CaF 2)i nF i g u r e 5.6. In Figure 5.6a, growth on the cubic ( a) and octahedral (b) faces remains constant,", "page": 110}

The situation is further complicated if physico- chemical conditions change during crystalliza- tion. In such cases, compositional zoning may occur as temperature changes. For example, plagio- clase crystallizing in a cooling magma becomes increasingly sodium rich as the temperature decreases. An observer may sometimes recognize an ap- parent habit characteristic of a certain mineral but, on closer inspection, discover that the ac- tual mineral is different from what was expected based on the morphology. In such cases, a new mineral of different structure or composition has replaced the original without changing the ini- tial shape. This inherited shape is misleading for identi\ufb01cation purposes and is called a pseudo- morph from the Greek /H9274/H9268/H9271/H9254\u00b4/H9257\u03c2(pseudes, meaning false) and /H9262/H9265/H9267/H9258\u00b4/H9257(morphe, meaning shape). Pyrite (FeS2) crystals are frequently replaced by limonite due to oxidation at surface conditions. Limonite is a massive brown powder-like aggregate of vari- ous Fe 3+ hydroxides. Pseudomorphs can preserve even small details of the initial crystal\u2019s surface, such as striations of pyrite (Figure 5.7). Plate 10a illustrates an azurite crystal (Cu 3(CO3)2(OH)2) (blue) that is partially replaced by malachite (Cu 2(CO3)(OH)2) (green). Pseudomorphs are like Fig. 5.7 Pseudomorphs of limonite after pyrite, preserving striations (width 35 mm) (courtesy P . Gennaro).

Medenbach). fossil evidence of former chemical processes and help us to infer mineral-forming processes and the geological history. Pseudomorphs may also develop during polymorphic transformations, preserving a mor- phology typical of different temperature and pressure conditions. Pseudohexagonal crystals, typical of hexagonal high-temperature /H9252-quartz in a volcanic rock, are testimony for a high- temperature origin above 573 \u25e6C (Figure 5.8), even though these crystals are presently trigonal low-temperature /H9251-quartz and one would expect a trigonal morphology. For quartz there are extraordinary cases of \u2018\u2018hollow pseudomorphs\u201d with perfectly euhedral cavities from which the original mineral has been completely dissolved. Skeletal crystals grow from highly supersatu- rated solutions, or melts, when diffusion of the atoms that compose the crystal is limited. Loca- tions with a high speci\ufb01c surface, i.e., edges and corners that are surrounded by the liquid phase, grow faster than faces (Figure 5.9a). The effect is that edges are protruding and faces are set back as in the halite crystal in Figure 5.9b. Skeletal growth is also prevalent in undercooled viscous volcanic melts and when volcanic glass crystal- lizes (devitrification) and diffusion is very sluggish.

The unique crystals resemble a branching plant, hence the name \u2018\u2018dendrites\u2019\u2019. Dendritic growth is typical in native gold, copper (Plate 8b), and silver and in pyrolusite (MnO 2) and other manganese oxides, precipitating on fractures (Figure 5.10). Fig. 5.10 Dendritic growth of manganese oxides (MnO2) on bedding planes of Solnhofen limestone (Germany). Growth initiates from fractures (width 55 mm) (courtesy E.H. Wenk). The growth morphology of crystals varies with physical conditions. This has been stud- ied extensively for snow, where the habit ranges from acicular needles to plates (Figure 5.11a) and dendrites (Figure 5.11b), all with a characteristic hexagonal shape. The variation in snow crystal morphology is a function of both supersaturation and temperature (Figure 5.12). Unlike snow, how- ever, the relationship of morphology and physi- cal conditions is poorly known for most mineral systems. We will discuss some examples of such typomorphism in Chapter 16. T winning During regular crystal growth one lattice layer after the next is added to a crystal face. The new layer has the same structure and composi- tion and is in the same orientation as the previ- ous one (Figure 5.13a). However, there is a cer- tain chance that a new layer is added in the \u2018\u2018wrong\u2019\u2019 orientation, still maintaining continu- ity and coherence (Figure 5.13b). This change in orientation increases the internal energy only very slightly because only second-closest neigh- bors across the interface are no longer in equi- librium positions. The \ufb01nal result is a bicrys- tal with identical structure and composition on either side of the planar defect, but with differ- ent orientations. Such an intergrowth is called a twin and it is usually recognized by the fact that there are re-entrant angles that usually do not exist in single crystals. In a single crystal, not counting dendritic or skeletal crystals, all inter- facial angles are usually larger than 180 \u25e6, when measured on the outside of a crystal, as \u03b1 in Figure 5.13a. (The corresponding angle between poles to the faces is 360 \u25e6 \u2212 \u03b1. The twin in Figure 5.13b shows a re-entrant angle \u03b2 that is smaller than 180\u25e6.) In general, twins are de\ufb01ned as intergrowths in which the two parts (twin and host) share a lattice plane, as described above (twin plane), or a lattice direction ( twin axis). The relative orienta- tion of the two parts of the crystal is well de\ufb01ned, either as a mirror re\ufb02ection across the twin plane or as a rotation around the twin axis.

The relative orientation of host and twin is best visualized with stereographic projection and this will be illustrated for quartz in Box 5.1. Twins frequently form during crystal growth. They also can result from phase transformations (see Chapter 6) or develop during deformation (see Chapter 13). Some commonly observed twin laws are summarized in Table 5.1. More examples will be discussed with speci\ufb01c minerals in Part IV. Aggregation Crystals in rocks usually constitute diverse ag- g r e g a t e sc o m p o s e do fc r y s t a l so fo n e ,t w o ,o r several minerals. Morphologically we can dis- tinguish several different types of aggregates, including granular, parallel-prismatic, druses, concretions, o \u00a8olites, and spherulites, among others. Granular aggregates are solid masses of min- eral grains, intergrown at random. For example a marble, formed by recrystallization of lime- stone, displays a regular pattern of equiaxed cal- cite grains with fairly straight boundaries and a polygonal pattern on a planar section (Fig- ure 5.17a). However, these boundaries are not crystal faces but merely accidental grain con- tacts. In such a recrystallized microstructure, \u2018\u2018triple junctions\u2019\u2019, where three grains meet, are most likely. By contrast, in open druses, groups of crystals grow perpendicularly or subperpen- dicularly to fractures or cavity linings (Figure 5.17b).

{"text": "AGGREGATION 93 Box 5.1 Stereographic projection and twinning in quartz Low-temperature /H9251-quartz (S iO2) is trigonal and crystallizes in point-group 32. This point-group has no center of symmetry and no mirror planes. Figure 5.16a displays a stereoplot both of symmetry elements in quartz and of poles of the unit rhombohedron {10\u00af11}. If we produce an intergrowth in which the two crystals are related by a 2-fold rotation on [0001], we obtain the pattern shown in Figure 5.16b. This intergrowth, called aDauphin\u00b4 e twin, has effectively a 2\u00d7 3 = 6-fold axis overall, but not locally, i.e., it has overall the hexagonal symmetry of /H9252-quartz. The two intergrown crystals are related by a rotation and therefore host and twin are both either right or left handed. A sketch of a Dauphin\u00b4 e penetration twin is also added in Figure 5.16e, with the twin indicated by shading. The composition surfaces are generally irregular. In another intergrowth of quartz, the two crystals are related by a mirror re\ufb02ection on {11\u00af20} (Figure 5.16c). In such Brazil twins, projections of poles of host and twin coincide and the overall pattern remains trigonal. But the mirror re\ufb02ection transforms the handedness. If the host is left handed, the twin is right handed. In this case twinning has effectively added a center of symmetry. Also here the twins are often intergrown with an irregular interface (Figure 5.16f). crystals are the \ufb01rst ones overgrowing a surface (Figure 5.18, I).

Massanek). time. In this section we will discuss three exam- ples: multicrystals, porphyroblasts, and poikilo- crystals. Multicrystals consist of slightly misoriented individual grains. Good examples are so-called quendels of quartz (Figure 5.21a) and roses of hematite (Figure 5.21b). The misorientation of these crystals can be caused in different ways. First, it may occur if a growing crystal ad- sorbs microparticles, or compositionally differ- ent layers. Such foreign particles do not \ufb01t a crystal\u2019s structure, but their size is comparable to the thickness of the added layer. If a new layer is deposited on a foreign particle, it is de\ufb02ected and continues growing in a slightly different orientation. In experiments it was observed that the angle between lattice planes of the original crystal and a subsidiary crystal does not exceed 20--30 \u2032, but this splitting may re- peat to form a fan of microcrystals with much larger de\ufb02ections. Such distortions become ap- parent as curved faces (Figure 5.22a), or as saddle structures (Figure 5.22b). Macroscopic crystals may grow in solid, some- what porous rock from intergranular solutions circulating between grains. During growth, pre- existing minerals may be completely or partially replaced by newly growing porphyroblasts. In the growth front, a \ufb01lm of capillary solution initiates the resorbtion and crystallization processes. Ex- ternally, porphyroblasts have the appearance of normal euhedral crystals, but sometimes they in- clude relicts of incompletely substituted country rock, such as in a so-called snowball garnet from a metamorphic schist that contains a spiral trail of inclusions which display rotations during the growth history (Figure 5.23). Poikilocrystals are particular varieties of crys- tals, growing in porous rocks that completely in- corporate the old rock structure. Gypsum crystals growing in Sahara sand above the groundwater level contain 50% sand grains, including \ufb01ne sedi- mentary structures (Sahara roses; Figure 5.24). The rhombohedral calcite crystals of Fontainebleau (France) are also poikilocrystals, and their volume consists of 75--80% of sand grains. Various growth effects Examined closely, even euhedral crystals often do not display ideally planar surfaces, but instead may contain striations, indentations, and conical protuberances. Crystal growth is locally hetero- geneous, and the picture outlined above, which assumes that consecutive layers of lattice planes are added, is highly simpli\ufb01ed. In detail, dis- locations (see Chapter 6) are a critical ingredi- ent of crystal growth (Frank, 1949). Figure 5.25a illustrates the lattice structure around a screw dislocation with a step in the lattice plane. In such steps it is most easy to add new unit cells, and growth preferentially proceeds from screw dislocations in a spiral fashion (Figure 5.25b).", "page": 119}

Dislocations aid in growth. They also are preferred sites for dissolution, since dislocation cores accumulate large strain energies. Etch pits on crystal surfaces are expressions of dissolution. They are generally symmetrical as in the case of calcite (Figure 5.26c), displaying the symmetry of that particular face, and have been used to deter- mine the point-group. Tourmaline from Namibia exempli\ufb01es an ex- treme case where symmetry is expressed in the dissolution geometry. Tourmaline (point-group 3m) has no center of symmetry and the two ends of the [0001] axis are structurally different. Crys- tals generally grow with a prismatic morphology parallel to [0001] (Figure 5.27a). A closer look at the positive end of the crystal displays regular growth faces (Figure 5.27b), while the negative end shows extensive dissolution, also with trigo- nal symmetry (Figure 5.27c). Striations on faces are commonly observed in tourmaline (Figure 5.27a). They form if a crys- tal grows in a solution under changing chemi- cal concentration, either decreasing or increas- ing. In pyrite the distinctly striated cube face is a combination of dominant {100} with sub- sidiary pentagon-dodecahedral growth {210}. The striations on the cube faces correspond to the intersection of the cube faces with faces of the pentagon-dodecahedron (Figure 5.28a and Plate 11c) and those on faces of the pentagon- dodecahedron correspond to intersections with the cube. These striations in pyrite are evidence that pyrite crystallizes in point group m\u00af3, which does not have a 4-fold axis perpendicular to the cube face. Similarly, striations on the prism face {10\u00af10} of quartz result from a combination of dominant prismatic and subsidiary rhombohe- dral {10\u00af11} growth (Figure 5.28b and Plates 6c,d). Crystals may contain homogeneous (solid, liq- uid, gas, glass-like) and heterogeneous inclusions. The inclusions can be remains of solid phases in- corporated in poikilocrystals, the grains of sub- stances that formed simultaneously, or alteration products forming later, such as sericitic mica in plagioclase. If a growing crystal cannot dis- solve pre-existing grains or push them away by its crystallization pressure (which can exceed 10 MPa), the crystal incorporates the foreign par- ticles. Sometimes the particles settle on the crys- tal surface and get covered with a new layer of the growing crystal, thus marking growth zones. 5 4 3 2 1 Lower level Higher level (a) (b) Fig. 5.25 (a) The lattice is distorted around a screw dislocation, producing steps on the surface.

{"text": "Chapter 6 Isomorphism, polymorphism, and crystalline defects Isomorphism and solid solutions Early mineralogists such as Niels Stensen (Nicolaus Steno) and Ren \u00b4eJ .H a \u00a8uy established that minerals of different composition have a dif- ferent morphology and that these morphological differences can be used to distinguish minerals. In 1821 the German chemist A. Eilhard Mitscher- lich made the unexpected observation that com- pounds of different chemical composition can have a very similar morphology and called this phenomenon isomorphism. Based on what we now know about crystal chemistry (see Chapter 2), we can interpret this result in terms of crystal struc- tures -- that is, in a crystal structure, atoms or ions can be replaced by others of similar size without changing the structure type. Carbonates, in particular, provide good exam- ples of minerals, with distinct chemical compo- sitions, that nonetheless have almost identical crystal forms and the same angles, as well as very similar rhombohedral crystal structures: Magnesite MgCO 3 r Mg2+ = 0.72 \u02daA Siderite FeCO 3 rFe2+ = 0.77 \u02daA Smithsonite ZnCO 3 r Zn2+ = 0.75 \u02daA Rhodochrosite MnCO 3 r Mn2+ = 0.82 \u02daA Calcite CaCO 3 rCa2+ = 1.00 \u02daA (low pressure) If the radius r of the substituting cation is larger than 1 \u02daA, then the structure changes to a different type with an orthorhombic lattice: Aragonite CaCO 3 r Ca2+ = 1.00 \u02daA (high pressure) Strontianite SrCO 3 r Sr2+ = 1.16 \u02daA Witherite BaCO 3 r Ba2+ = 1.36 \u02daA Notice that the radius of Ca 2+ is close to 1 \u02daAa n d CaCO3 can exist in either the rhombohedral structure as calcite or the orthorhombic struc- ture as aragonite, depending on external condi- tions. We will come back to this effect later in this chapter. A special type of isomorphism is when atoms or cations replace one another in arbitrary amounts. Such crystals are called solid solutions or mixed crystals. A good example of a solid solution is olivine, with similar ionic radii of magnesium and iron. The pure chemical components, called end members,a r e : Forsterite Mg 2SiO4 rMg2+ = 0.72 \u02daA Fayalite Fe 2SiO4 r Fe2+ = 0.77 \u02daA Most natural olivines, for example in basalts or peridotites, have intermediate compositions. There are many solid solutions in minerals and we will discuss them later. For now let us simply mention pyroxenes (see Chapter 28) and feldspars (see Chapter 19) as examples. In pyroxenes there are solid solutions between magnesium and iron, as in olivine: Diopside CaMgSi 2O6 r Mg2+ = 0.72 \u02daA Hedenbergite CaFeSi 2O6 r Fe2+ = 0.77 \u02daA", "page": 125}

In this case, a coupled substitution of Si 4+ for Al 3+, which are both of similar size (rSi4+ = 0.26 \u02daA, rAl3+ = 0.39 \u02daA, for coordination number 4), has to occur to maintain electrostatic neutrality. Solid solutions between magnesium and iron (as in olivine and diopside) occur at all tem- peratures. Mixing of magnesium and calcium (in pyroxenes), and potassium and sodium (in feldspars), on the other hand, occur only at high temperature, since there is a considerable size difference between substituting ions. This will be discussed in Chapter 18. In a mixed crystal, substitution by atoms of different sizes causes changes in lattice param- eters, as is illustrated in Figure 6.1 for some face-centered cubic (fcc) metals. The relationship between solid solution composition and lattice parameter a is fairly linear if there is no interac- tion between substituting atoms. (This correspon- dence is known as Vegard\u2019s rule.) However, if there is additional attraction or repulsion between like and unlike atoms, one observes deviations from the linear relationship that are most signi\ufb01cant for intermediate compositions. Finally, we note that there also exist com- pounds that have identical crystal structures but that do not mix chemically. Examples of such isostructural crystals are halite (NaCl), galena 4.10 4.00 3.90 3.80 3.70 3.60 3.50 a (\u00c5) 0 20 40 60 80 100 Atomic percentage Ag Pt Pd Cu Au Pd Ni Fig. 6.1 Solid solutions between some cubic metals and the in\ufb02uence of the chemical composition on the lattice parameter.

The structures of these compounds are identical owing to the very similar cation:anion radius ratios that the compounds display. Polymorphism and phase transitions With the example of carbonates, we demon- strated above that the structure of a chemical compound does not change if we substitute dif- ferent ions of similar size. However, structures of the same chemical compound may be differ- ent under different physical conditions. For ex- ample, CaCO 3 crystallizes as calcite at low pres- sure and as aragonite at high pressure. If a com- pound exists with different crystal structures, depending on external conditions, this is known as polymorphism and was \ufb01rst discovered by Mitscherlich (1820, 1821). Examples of polymor- phic minerals are numerous. Polymorphism is a very useful property", "page": 126}

One example is aragonite, which forms in high- pressure subduction environments and still ex- ists, for example, in rocks of the Coast Ranges of California, USA. Another example of polymorphism is SiO 2.A t low temperature and low pressure this chemi- cal compound crystallizes as quartz. A schematic view of the crystal structure, projected along the c-axis, displays an arrangement of triangles with trigonal symmetry (Figure 6.2a). (Circles represent silicon atoms that are tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygens.) This variety of quartz is called low temperature or /H9251-quartz. Above a certain temper- ature, the arrangement of tetrahedra becomes more symmetrical and we recognize a 6-fold symmetry axis (hexagonal) (Figure 6.2b). This poly- m o r p ho fS i O 2 is called high temperature or /H9252- quartz. At even higher temperature, SiO 2 exists in yet a different structure, called cristobalite. All these SiO 2 polymorphs have in common that four oxygen atoms, outlining a tetrahedron, surround silicon and these tetrahedra are linked over cor- ners to a three-dimensional framework. However, at very high pressure, SiO 2 changes its coordina- tion number and silicon is in octahedral coordi- nation as stishovite, found at meteor impact sites. When a compound changes its structure, for example by heating or under pressure, it un- dergoes a phase transition. Phase transitions are special isochemical cases of the more general class of phase transformations. In a very gen- eral way, when pressure is applied, a mineral may transform to a structure with denser pack- ing. If the temperature is raised, thermal vibra- tions become more pronounced. Atoms may lose their identity and the structure may become dis- ordered. Changes may be very minor, such as be- tween /H9251-a n d/H9252-quartz, where there is a slight dis- tortion of the structure (Figure 6.2); or they may be substantial, as in the transition of diamond to graphite, which involves a change in bonding type, and a total rearrangement. M.J. Buerger, in 1951, classi\ufb01ed phase transitions into three types (reconstructive, order--disorder, displacive) based on the structural changes that occur (Table 6.1). This is schematically illustrated in Figure 6.3 for a hypothetical two-dimensional ionic structure with square coordination polygons. Reconstructive transitions (Figure 6.3a,b) These transitions require the breaking of bonds and a subsequent internal rearrangement, re- sulting in a new structure that may be quite different from the initial one. In Figure 6.3a coordination polyhedra remain intact, but they are differently arranged and linked. In the original structure they are in four-membered rings; in the transformed structure they are in three- and six-membered rings. Since the closest neighborhood, i.e., the environment of cations by surrounding anions, remains in- tact, Buerger classi\ufb01ed", "page": 127}

A good example for such transitions is quartz (coordination num- ber (Si) = 4) transforming at high pressure to stishovite (coordination number (Si) = 6). The most severe reconstructive transitions occur when there is a change in the type of bonding, such as in the transition from hexagonal metal- lic graphite to cubic covalent diamond.

For example, the diamond phase of carbon is preserved for billions of years in kim- berlites, even though diamond is not stable at the pressure and temperature conditions found on the surface of the earth. In reconstructive transitions, atoms have to move within the struc- ture and this requires diffusion and thermal activation. Order\u2013disorder transitions These transitions apply to structures where two different atomic species can occupy the same lat- tice sites. At high temperature two atomic species (black and white circles in Figure 6.3c) may be dis- tributed randomly in the coordination polyhedra (left side). Upon cooling the distribution becomes regular, with black and white species alternat- ing (right side). Such a distribution is said to be \u2018\u2018ordered\u2019\u2019. Figure 6.4 illustrates, with the distri- bution of black and white squares, that there may be a whole range of ordering patterns. In Figure 6.4b the distribution is random; in Figure 6.4a it is more ordered than random, with a ten- dency for alternation of black and white squares, and in Figure 6.4c it is less ordered than ran- d o m ,w i t ht h ed e v e l o p m e n to fc l u s t e r so fe q u a l kind. A simple example to illustrate ordering is the Cu--Au system. At high temperature Cu and Au atoms are distributed randomly over the sites of an fcc lattice with an equal probability for Cu and Au to be on any site (Figure 6.5a). At these high temperature conditions Au--Cu forms a solid solution and any amount of Cu can substitute for Au, causing a change in the lattice parameter a (Figure 6.1), which can be used to determine the composition. At low temperature, the atoms are ordered and the ordering pattern depends on the composition. For a composition Au 3Cu, Cu occupies the corners of the fcc lattice and Au is at the face centers (Figure 6.5b). The struc- ture is still cubic, but no longer face-centered (the atoms on the centers of faces are different from those at the corners of the unit cell). For a composition AuCu, a layered tetragonal struc- ture forms (Figure 6.5c). This structure has only a single 4-fold symmetry axis, compared to three axes in the cubic case.

The individual square is not changed, only the angles between neighboring squares. The transition from /H9251-(low-temperature) to /H9252- (high-temperature) quartz (Figure 6.2) is typical of a displacive transition. Relative to hexagonal /H9252-quartz, oxygen atoms are slightly displaced in trigonal /H9251-quartz (indicated by arrows in Fig- ure 6.2a). The lattice energies of the parent and daughter phases in displacive transitions are very similar. Also, since no diffusion is re- quired, displacive transitions are rapid and can- not be quenched. In the case of quartz, the high-temperature phase cannot be preserved. All quartz at ambient conditions is /H9251-quartz and all quartz above 573 \u25e6Ci s /H9252-quartz. As our discussion above indicates, polymor- phic phase transitions are usually discussed in terms of temperature and pressure changes and we will look at this in a more quantitative man- ner in Chapter 17.

With line de- fects or dislocations, the perfect lattice is disrupted and displaced along a line labeled D that extends perpendicular to the sketch (Figure 6.6b). Planar defects are characterized by displacement over a whole plane of atoms such as in this so-called stacking fault (SF), again extending perpendicular to the sketch (Figure 6.6c). Linear and planar de- fects cause substantial local distortions of the crystal structure. The strain produced by these distortions can best be imaged with the trans- mission electron microscope (TEM) because elec- trons passing through the crystal are de\ufb02ected (see Chapter 12). Point defects The main in\ufb02uence of a point defect extends over only a few atomic diameters. The defect may be the result of a single atom (vacancy or intersti- tial; Figure 6.7a) or, more rarely, a cluster of a few. In ionic crystals, the formation of a vacancy involves a local readjustment of charge to main- tain neutrality in the crystal as a whole. If a posi- tive ion vacancy is compensated for by a negative ion vacancy such a pair is called a Schottky defect (Figure 6.7b). Alternatively a positive", "page": 130}

Dislocations (line defects) When single crystals are subjected to shearing stresses, plastic deformation occurs on one or more sets of de\ufb01ned lattice planes ( hkl)k n o w n as slip planes. The slip planes are sheared in a speci\ufb01c lattice direction [uvw], which is the slip direction. Large discrepancies between the ob- served strengths of crystals and their theoretical strengths calculated on the assumption that slip occurred instantaneously across the slip planes, led E. Orowan (1934), M. Polanyi (1934), and G.I. Taylor (1934) and others to introduce the concept of dislocations.

This slippage has transported the upper part of the crystal over the lower part by one unit cell in the direction of the vector b, so that the lattice perfection is restored across the slipped area except along the curved dislocation line extending from point A to point B. The displacement vector b is called the Burgers vector. At A, where the dislocation line is perpen- dicular to b, the lattice distortion is effectively caused by an extra vertical plane on top.

Ulti- mately all the bonds across the slip plane have been broken, but the process occurs only in the vicinity of the dislocation so that relatively low stresses are required to cause slip and changes in crystal shape. Taylor (1934) inferred the presence of dislo- cations from indirect evidence. His model has much later been con\ufb01rmed by direct imaging of dislocations with the TEM (see Chapter 12). Since the electronic structure is distorted along the dis- location core, this distortion leads to strong con- trast when electrons pass through a crystal, and dislocations appear as lines (Figure 6.10). Dislocations are necessary for deformation. Without dislocations materials would be ex- tremely strong. They are introduced during crys- tal growth at a density of about 10 6 dislocations/ cm2. Dislocations multiply during deformation and can reach densities as high as 10 14 disloca- tions/cm2 (as will be discussed in Chapter 13). Planar defects Planar defects are important in the context of phase transformations. As we have noted above in our discussion of polymorphism and solid so- lutions, many minerals undergo phase transfor- mations during cooling. At high temperature, they are often structurally disordered and chem- ically homogeneous. Upon cooling, they may or- der themselves to a structure with a lower sym- metry (e.g., from hexagonal to trigonal quartz, or from monoclinic sanidine to triclinic microcline). Alternatively, a mineral that is homogeneous at high temperature may separate into domains of different composition at lower temperature by a process called exsolution. The substitution may in- volve all atoms in the structure, such as in Au--Cu, or only a certain set such as Mg and Fe in (Mg, Fe) 2SiO4 (olivine). 1 \u00b5m Fig. 6.10 TEM image of dislocations in experimentally deformed dolomite (courtesy D.J.

At high temperature (top), atoms A and B are disordered. At low temperature (bottom), exsolution occurs if like atoms attract each other (bottom left), and ordering takes place if unlike atoms attract each other (bottom right). During exsolution and/or ordering, domains may form that differ in composition and/or ordering pattern. This is illustrated schematically for a solid solution with atoms A and B in Figure 6.11. At high temperature, A and B are distributed ran- domly, i.e., on every site in the structure there is an equal probability of having either A or B (Figure 6.11, top). A unit cell is outlined by shad- ing. When this system is cooled, two different processes may take place by diffusion and rear- rangement of atomic species. If like atoms attract each other, there is a ten- dency for a solid solution to undergo a phase separation by exsolution, resulting in domains of different composition of A and B (Figure 6.11, bottom left). The boundary between the composi- tionally different domains within a macroscopic crystal is called an interphase interface and is often planar to minimize the lattice mis\ufb01t between the domains. Since A and B are atoms of different size, lattice parameters a A and aB in the domains will also be different. Frequently planar inter- faces repeat in a macroscopic crystal, giving rise to an array of exsolution lamellae that are often submicroscopic. We will return to a more quan- titative discussion of exsolution in Chapter 18.

We now look at some aspects of ordering.A s we have seen, the rearrangement of atoms from a disordered to an ordered state is often accom- panied by a reduction in symmetry. This loss in symmetry can be due either to compositional ordering (such as in Au--Cu (see Figure 6.5), or the Al--Si distribution in feldspars), or positional ordering (such as the geometry of silicon tetrahe- dra in /H9251-a n d /H9252-quartz; see Figure 6.2). Once or- dering commences from two independent nucle- ation sites in a disordered crystal (Figure 6.14a), the ordered regions or domains continue to ex- pand until they impinge on each other (Figure 6.14b). The domains will either coalesce into a single domain (this occurs when the atomic se- quences at the interfaces are perfectly \u2018\u2018in step\u2019\u2019), or will be separated by a boundary. An ordered crystal can consist of one domain or of many domains.

Unlike exsolution domains, ordering domains all have the same chemical composition (Figure 6.11, bottom right). Boundaries that separate ordered domains can be classi\ufb01ed according to the structural change across the boundary. If the lattices in the two domains can be brought to coincidence by a translation, the boundaries between the lattices are called antiphase boundaries or APBs (Figure 6.15a; see also Figure 6.11 (bottom right) and Figure 6.14b).

Planar defects may be produced during phase transformations, but they can also form during growth and even during deformation. Radiation defects The defects discussed above have a well-de\ufb01ned geometry. Also, the density of the defects is rel- atively low, so that overall the lattice remains intact. Radiation, however, can in\ufb02ict more se- rious damage to the crystal structure. Take, for example, a small inclusion of zircon (ZrSiO 4) in a biotite (K(Mg, Fe) 3 Si3(Al, Fe)O10OH2) crystal. Zircon generally contains traces of uranium and thorium, which emit /H9253-radiation. Over geologi- cal time, this radiation alters the crystal struc- ture of biotite. One result of these alterations is the development of haloes in biotite, with dif- ferent colors that surround the zircon inclusion. More generally, the lattice structures of uranium- and thorium-containing minerals are often com- pletely destroyed over time in a process known as metamictization. This has become an important issue in the context of storing nuclear waste. There are proposals to incorporate radioactive el- ements into stable synthetic minerals (synrock); yet it is very dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd mineral species that resist metamictization.

{"text": "Chapter 7 Experimental studies of crystal structures. X-ray diffraction Basic concepts The notion that crystals have a lattice-based struc- ture and that the basic building block is the unit cell was introduced in the eighteenth century. At that time the analysis of crystals was based on visual inspection, on detailed examination with a hand lens or at best a light microscope. How- ever, visible light, with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, is far too coarse a probe to inves- tigate crystal structures where information is on the scale of atoms and interatomic distances, i.e., 1--5 \u02daA( 1 \u02daA = 0.1 nm). In this chapter we discuss experimental techniques that were developed in the early twentieth century to study crystal lat- tices, providing a tool for determining structural parameters and largely con\ufb01rming the concepts about unit parallelepipeds, lattice structure, and symmetry suggested more than 100 years earlier. With the discovery of X-rays by C.W. R \u00a8ontgen in 1895, the stage was set for analyzing crystals at an elementary level, and this research produced unprecedented information about the solid state. Then in 1912 the famous diffraction experiment of Max von Laue established that X-rays are waves and that the suspected internal lattice structure of crystals indeed existed (for a brief history, see Box 7.1). R\u00a8ontgen found that when electrons were ac- celerated in an electric \ufb01eld and collided with a metal anode, a very high-energy radiation was emitted. At the time, he was unable to explain the origin of this radiation (hence the name \u2018\u2018X-rays\u2019\u2019), and an explanation had to wait until more was known about the structure of atoms. It became clear that accelerated electrons with suf\ufb01ciently high energy could displace electrons from within the inner electron shells (e.g., a K- shell electron) of an atom (Figure 7.1a). This is because the energy of the electrons within the inner shells is close to, but slightly less than, the energy of the accelerated electrons. An electron from a higher shell immediately \ufb01lls the elec- tron hole, and the excess energy is released as a photon. The energy, and hence the wavelength, corresponds to the particular electronic transi- tion of a given atom. These high-energy photons have short wavelengths \u03bb (\u03bb = hc/eV, where h is the Planck constant, c the speed of light, e the charge of the electron, and V the accelerat- ing voltage) in the range 0.1--5 \u02daA, and are called X-rays. A spectrum, obtained when a metal such as copper or molybdenum is irradiated with 50 keV electrons, is shown in Figure 7.1b. It con- sists of both a continuous part due to irregular energy exchanges between electrons, and a set of high-intensity peaks due to the speci\ufb01c energy transitions. For example, L- to K-shell transitions produce K /H9251X-rays, and M- to K-shell transitions produce K /H9252X-rays. Note that X-rays produced from a molybdenum target have higher energies and shorter wavelengths than those produced from a copper target. This is because molybde- num has a higher atomic number.", "page": 140}

{"text": "118 X-RAY DIFFRACTION Figure 7.2 shows a schematic diagram of a mod- ern X-ray tube. It consists of an evacuated glass tube in which electrons are released by heating a tungsten \ufb01lament (just as in a normal light bulb). By applying a voltage, the electrons are then accelerated in a \ufb01eld to 40--50 keV and collide with an anode metal (molybdenum in Figure 7.2). Box 7.1 Brief early history of X-ray crystallography Wilhelm Conrad R\u00a8 ontgen discovered X-rays in W\u00a8 urzburg in 1895. He constructed a cathode ray tube, enclosing it in a light-tight cardboard box, and observed a pe- culiar phenomenon. When he sent a pulse of electrons (cathode rays) through this tube, a screen made of barium platinocyanide crystals, placed at some distance from the tube, would light up in bright \ufb02uorescence. R\u00a8 ontgen knew that the \ufb02uo- rescence was not caused by the cathode rays, for the glass tube absorbed electrons. Some other mysterious radiation of high energy had to be involved, and he named this radiation \u201cX-rays\u201d. X-rays were found to have high penetration properties, and for this reason the \ufb01rst practical application of X-rays was for radiography. A turning point in crystallography came in 1912. An exceptional group of scientists were then at the University of Munich. They included: Professor Paul von Groth, a crystallographer; Professor Wilhelm Conrad R\u00a8 ontgen, who was now Chair of Experimental Physics; and Professor A. Sommerfeld in the Department of Theoretical Physics. There were also a number of assistants and students, among them Dr Max von Laue and Peter Debye (both Sommerfeld\u2019s assistants), and W. Friedrich and P . Knipping (graduate students of R\u00a8 ontgen). Crystallographers such as Groth claimed that crystals were built up of periodic arrangements of molecules, and Sommerfeld believed that X-rays were wave-like radiation. Von Laue was curious to \ufb01nd out what would happen if X-rays interacted with crystals. This curiosity led to the famous experiment, performed by Friedrich and Knipping on a crystal of copper sulfate, in which diffraction was observed (Figure 7.3a), proving that crystals indeed had lattice character and that X-rays were waves (Friedrich et al., 1912; von Laue, 1913). Shortly after the discovery by von Laue, Friedrich and Knipping, the British physicist William Henry Bragg at the University of Leeds and his son William Lawrence Bragg, a graduate student at Cambridge University, collaborated to in- terpret the intensities of X-ray diffraction and were able to relate them to the crystal structure. X-ray diffraction patterns display the internal symmetry of crys- tals (Figure 7.3b). The Braggs explained X-ray diffraction as selective re\ufb02ection on lattice planes (Bragg and Bragg, 1913) and used the diffraction data to determine the unit cell and crystal structure, \ufb01rst of halite and then of other minerals in 1913 (Bragg, 1914). Interestingly, the Russian scientist G. Wulff, after whom the Wulff net is named, derived independently an expression that is very similar to Bragg\u2019s law (Wulff, 1913).

For \u03c6 = 75 \u25e6, Anew = 1.59 \u00d7 A;f o r\u03c6 = 2\u03c0 = 360\u25e6, Anew = 2 \u00d7 A (this is an important case which we will call constructive interference); and for \u03c6 = 2\u03c0 = 180\u25e6, Anew = 0( destructive interference. In this case the resultant wave has no amplitude). Instead of doing this addition graphically, we can use equation 7.2 and simply add the two wave vectors (both with the amplitude A): f1 + f2 = A{(cos \u03c61 + cos \u03c62) + i(sin \u03c61 + sin \u03c62)} = A(X + Yi ) Anew = A(\u221a(X2 + Y 2) and \u03c6new = tan\u22121(Y/X) (7.3) \u03c6 = 75\u25e6 : f1 + f2 = A[(cos 0\u25e6 + cos 75\u25e6) + i(sin 0\u25e6 + sin 75\u25e6)] = A(1.26 + 0.97i) = A(X + Yi ) Anew = (A\u221a(X2 + Y 2) = A\u221a(1.262 + 0.972) = 1.59A, and \u03c6new = tan\u22121 (Y/X) = 37.6\u25e6 (7.4) \u03c6 = 2\u03c0 = 360\u25e6 : f1 + f2 = A[(cos 0\u25e6 + cos 360\u25e6) + i(sin 0\u25e6 + sin 360\u25e6)] = A(2 + 0i) = A(X + Yi ) Anew = (A\u221a(X2 + Y 2) = A\u221a(22 + 02) = 2A, and \u03c6new = tan\u22121(Y/X) = 0\u25e6 (7.5) \u03c6 = \u03c0 = 180\u25e6 : f1 + f2 = A[(cos 0\u25e6 + cos 180\u25e6) + i(sin 0\u25e6 + sin 180\u25e6)] = A(0 + 0i) = A(X + Yi ) Anew = (A\u221a(X2 + Y 2) = A\u221a(02 + 02) = 0 and \u03c6new = tan\u22121(Y/X) = 90\u25e6 (7.6) which provides the same results as those ob- tained graphically, but is much easier to do.

To explain diffraction, let us assume that a wave front of X-rays reaches a row of atoms. Each atom (or, more correctly, each electron) acts as a scattering center for a spherical wave of equal wavelength and, in di- rect analogy to Huygens\u2019 construction for visi- ble light, new wave fronts form. In two dimen- sions these spherical waves appear as circles with wave fronts tangent to them (Figure 7.6). Each circle represents the collection of points that lie one full wavelength (measured between wave crests) from the atoms. The most obvious tan- gent to these circles is parallel to the incident wave front. This is called the zero-order new wave front. But there are other directions into which waves are de\ufb02ected. There is a first-order wave front that is inclined to the old wave front. There are also second- and higher-order wave fronts, and they can be drawn as tangents to wave crests from X-rays, with different arrival times (Figure 7.6).

The maximum possible path difference between two lattice points is 2 a (\u03c6 \u25e6 a = 0\u25e6, \u03c6a = 180\u25e6), and therefore n1 can vary only within certain limits such that n1 < |2a/\u03bb|; that is, only a limited number of full wavelengths can", "page": 145}

Then we label the phase dif- ferences (in multiples of wavelengths) for each lattice point with respect to the origin in the \ufb01gure, i.e., 0, 2, 4, etc. For a two-dimensional crystal we must add a second Laue condition to that given above (equation 7.7a). By analogy it is: PDb = ( cos \u03c6b \u2212 cos \u03c60 b ) b = n2 \u00d7 \u03bb (7.7b) where angles \u03c60 b and \u03c6b are between the row of lattice points with spacing b in the y-direction and incoming and diffracted ray, respectively.

The two crossing directions x and y in Figure 7.9b can be extended easily to a full two-dimensional lattice by keeping in mind that, in a lattice, all points and thus all distances between lattice points in a speci\ufb01c di- rection are identical. The total phase difference of any lattice point with respect to the origin is 2\u03c0(n 1 + n2), and we label the points accordingly.

Initially they are in phase, and after diffraction they establish a new wave front. As the \ufb01gure il- lustrates, the individual paths in the three cases are different. The same path length for waves 1 and 2, and thus zero phase difference, is obtained only for the special geometry when incoming and diffracted waves are in mirror re\ufb02ection geom- etry on the lattice plane (Figure 7.10c). This re- stricts the direction of incident and diffracted beam relative to the lattice planes, with all points having the same path difference in Figure 7.9b, and brings us to another interpretation of X-ray diffraction -- namely, as re\ufb02ection on lat- tice planes de\ufb01ned by Miller indices (hkl). The terms diffraction and re\ufb02ection are often used interchangeably. In Figure 7.10 we have considered a single lattice plane and investigated diffraction condi- tions. Real crystals, however, consist of stacks of lattice planes, and X-rays penetrate many hun- dred. How are the phase relations between waves re\ufb02ected on two adjacent lattice planes separated by distance d (Figure 7.11)? Two waves, which are initially in phase, reach a crystal. The \ufb01rst (1) diffracts (re\ufb02ects) on the lat- tice plane (hkl) on the surface, the second one (2) on the parallel plane below at a distance d = AC. The angle of incidence to the lattice plane is \u03b8. The second wave has a longer path (PD = BC + CD), before the two waves establish a new wave front AD.

Diffraction occurs at a speci\ufb01c angle that is determined by the d-spacing of the lattice planes. These conditions are seemingly very straightfor- ward but are not easy to satisfy experimentally. If we aim a monochromatic X-ray at a crystal in some arbitrary orientation, the Bragg condi- tions are not satis\ufb01ed and no diffraction occurs.

The powder method A powder consists of many randomly oriented small crystals or \u2018\u2018crystallites\u2019\u2019. There will always be some crystallites with lattice planes in the right orientation to diffract (i.e., satisfying the \ufb01rst Bragg condition), and therefore rotation is not necessary. A powder irradiated with mono- chromatic X-rays of known wavelength will pro- duce diffracted X-rays lying on cones with an opening angle 4\u03b8 (i.e., an angle 2\u03b8 to the primary X-ray beam). We can intersect these cones with a photographic \ufb01lm, usually mounted in a cylin- drical \u2018\u2018Debye--Scherrer\u2019\u2019 camera, and image a set of concentric rings (Figure 7.12a). After exposure, the \ufb01lm is unrolled, developed and diffraction an- gles can be measured as distances between dark lines. Today the most popular powder method uses a powder diffractometer. The powder is sus- pended on a \ufb02at disk, and the re\ufb02ections are scanned with an electronic detector (Figure 7.12b) that digitally records the intensity as a function of diffraction angle, as is shown for a sample of cubic halite in Figure 7.13.

Preferred ori- entation of platy minerals on diffractometer mounts often distorts the true intensity pat- tern. Today, searches can be accomplished with a computer. The X-ray powder method has become the standard technique for identifying crystalline substances and is applied in every mineralogy laboratory. It is fast, safe, and accurate. X-rays and crystal structure So far in our discussion we have concentrated on the angular directions of diffracted X-rays. These directions simply depend on the lattice geome- try. From the angles 2\u03b8 between incident and diffracted X-rays we obtain information about the unit cell. Ultimately we are not concerned so much about the lattice as we are about the distri- bution of atoms in a crystal, i.e., the crystal struc- ture. For example, the minerals halite (NaCl), pyrite (FeS), and \ufb02uorite (CaF) all have a similar cubic unit cell ( a \u2248 5.5 \u02daA), yet an entirely differ- ent crystal structure. Can we distinguish them, based on their diffraction pattern? The answer is \u2018\u2018yes\u201d, and without too much additional effort we can show how diffraction intensities are related to atomic positions, using a similar approach. Take, for example, a structure consisting of two atomic species, A and B (Figure 7.16), that can be considered as a superposition of two lattices. Each lattice obeys Bragg\u2019s law, but the two lattices generally do not scatter in phase and the intensity of the scattered wave for a re\ufb02ection hkl depends on the phase shift between lattice A and lattice B. To evaluate the phase shift we return to the two-dimensional picture of Figure 7.9, except that we add a second species (open circles in Figure 7.17). The second lattice (open circles) is displaced by fractional coordinates x, y against x2 x1 y2y1 A at 0, 0 B at x, y y x Fig. 7.17 Phase differences resulting from diffraction on a two-dimensional crystal with two atomic species indicated by closed circles (A) and open circles (B).

{"text": "ADDITIONAL ATOMIC SCATTERING CONSIDERATIONS 131 the \ufb01rst lattice (dots). For a simple lattice, with a single atom in the corner of the unit cell, we found that the phase shifts of a lattice point relative to an origin are 2\u03c0(n 1 + n2), where n1 and n2 are integers. The phase shifts for the second lattice (B, open circles) relative to the lattice in the origin (A, closed circles) are 2 \u03c0(n 1x + n2 y). In general, X-ray scattering from these two lattices is not in phase. If we sum the waves, intensities will vary, depending on the relative displacements x and y. The displacements x and y correspond to atomic coordinates, relative to the corners of the unit cell; n 1 and n2 are orders of diffraction, for which we can substitute the Laue indices h and k and thus obtain for the phase shift \u03c6 = 2\u03c0(hx + ky). If we consider a three-dimensional crystal structure composed of n sublattices of atoms at fractional coordinates x i , yi , zi relative to the cor- ner of the unit cell, then the phase shifts for a diffraction hkl are for each atom, by analogy with the two-dimensional case, \u03c6i = 2\u03c0(hxi + kyi + lzi )( 7.13) In order to obtain the amplitude and phase of the diffracted wave, we have to add the individual waves that are scattered from all atoms in the u n i tc e l l .I nB o x7 . 3w ed ot h i sf o rt h ee x a m p l e of halite, using the method we discussed earlier (equation 7.2). Box 7.3 Diffraction intensities and the atomic structure of halite In Chapter 3 (see Figure 3.24b) we described the structure of halite with fractional coordinates x, y, z. These coordinates are again shown in the table below for the four Na+ and four Cl\u2212 that occupy the unit cell. X-rays scatter on the electrons surrounding the nucleus of an atom and the scattering strength or amplitude of the wave scattered from an atom is, to a \ufb01rst approximation, proportional to the number of electrons, or atomic number, i.e., 11 for Na + and 17 for Cl \u2212. This scattering amplitude is referred to as the scattering factor fi . The summation of individual wavelets scattered by each atom can be done graphically by adding all the waves with amplitudes fi and phases \u03c6i = 2\u03c0(hxi + ky i + lz i ), or we can do it algebraically by adding the vector components, gener- alizing equation 7.2: Fhkl = \u2211 fi [cos 2\u03c0(hxi + kyi + lzi ) + sin 2\u03c0i(hxi + kyi + lzi )] = X + iY (7.14) Additional atomic scattering considerations For quantitative intensity calculations, we have to re\ufb01ne the model of the structure factor.

In (200), waves from all atoms scatter in phase (same sign), while in (111) waves from Na and Cl are out of phase. The square of the amplitudes is proportional to the observed intensities of the scattered waves. Indeed, on the powder diffraction pattern of halite shown in Figure 7.13 we \ufb01nd that (200) is much stronger than (111), and (100) is absent. We noted that the amplitude for (100) is zero, and therefore we call this re\ufb02ection \u201cextinct\u201d. Someextinctions (i.e., lack of any diffraction intensity) are purely accidental, caused by a particular arrangement of atoms. Others are systematic and an expression of the crystal symmetry. These systematic extinctions are used to determine translational symmetries and the space-group. The (100) extinction in halite is due to the face-centered structure with a translation 1 2 , 1 2 , 0.

Instead of X-rays, neutrons can be used for diffraction experiments. Neutrons scatter on the nucleus and since the nucleus is in\ufb01nitely small, there is no angle dependence of the neutron scattering factor. While neutron diffraction has many advantages over X-rays, it is rarely used. To produce a neutron beam of suf\ufb01cient \ufb02ux, one needs either a nuclear reactor or a linear accelerator.

The reason for this is their complexity because, in contrast to chemical composition, many properties cannot be described by simple numbers. Physical proper- ties are intricately linked to the structure and the symmetry of crystals.

Nye\u2019s (1957) book Physical Properties of Crystals. The relation- ships are more transparent if some linear algebra is applied, and for this reason we introduce a few concepts concerning tensors. If you do not have the background in mathematics that is required, you can skip pp. 134--142 without missing the general context. In that case, you will simply have to accept the fact that optical properties of crys- tals have the \u2018\u2018shape\u2019\u2019 of an ellipsoid (see Chapters 9 and 10). A physical property of a material can be de- termined by suitable measurements and gives a relationship between two physical quantities. For example, the density relates a volume ele- ment and the corresponding mass. A more com- plicated property is the thermal conductivity, which relates an imposed temperature gradient to a resulting heat \ufb02ux. The temperature gradi- ent can be looked upon as a \u2018\u2018stimulus\u2019\u2019 acting upon the material and the rate of heat \ufb02ux as a \u2018\u2018response\u2019\u2019 resulting from the interaction of the material and the stimulus.

Many physical properties of minerals, such as density, thermal conductivity, electrical con- ductivity, thermal expansion and elasticity, can have a straightforward mathematical descrip- tion. Other properties do not uniquely relate physical quantities. For example, the plastic prop- erties of a crystal cannot be de\ufb01ned like the elas- tic properties, in terms of a unique relationship between stress and strain, but instead depend on the history of a particular crystal. We will discuss plastic deformation of crystals in Chapter 13. In this chapter we investigate some physical proper- ties of crystals with a unique stimulus--response relationship. These physical quantities can be divided into two classes. There is one type, such as density or speci\ufb01c heat, that is not connected in any way to direction. Such quantities are called scalars and are completely speci\ufb01ed with a single number, as in equation 8.2. Most quantities, though, can be de\ufb01ned only with reference to directions.

If we conduct the same experiment on a slab cut perpendicular to the c-axis we observe a circular isotherm (Figure 8.1b). In this section thermal conductivity is the same in all directions. As we will see later, the crystal symmetry imposes restrictions on phys- ical properties. For example, in a cubic crys- tal the thermal conductivity is the same in all directions. As an alternative to specifying a vector v by magnitude and direction (e.g., by an arrow), a vector can also be described with components of a rectangular coordinate system x 1, x2, x3, just as we have used zone indices and lattice parame- ters to describe a lattice direction (Figure 8.2). The components are simply projections of the vector on the axes. If the components of \u2207 T are T1, T2, T3, we can write \u2207T = [T1, T2, T3], where Ti = dT /dxi (8.3) and the three components completely specify the vector.

In component nomenclature we obtain q1 =\u2212 \u03baT1, q2 =\u2212 \u03baT2, q3 =\u2212 \u03baT3, (8.5) in which each component of q is proportional to the corresponding component of \u2207T . For crystals, which have a lattice structure and directionality, the situation is not so simple and the vectors q and \u2207T may not be parallel, because of the interaction of the heat \ufb02ow with the crystal structure (Figure 8.3b).

Each component of q is now linearly related to all three components of \u2207T .

We must \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne how the two sets of axes are related to each other, which can be done by giving the direction cosines a ij , specifying each new x\u2032 i -axis in terms of the old xj - a x e s( i l l u s t r a t e di nF i g u r e8 . 4f o rt h e new axis x\u2032 3).

Such tensors are centro symmetrical, as are all second-rank ten- sors. For thermodynamic reasons many tensors (including all those discussed in this chapter) have the property that coef\ufb01cients \u03ba ij = \u03baji , i.e., they are symmetrical across the diagonal, and we can write: \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a3 \u03ba11 \u03ba12 \u03ba13 \u03ba12 \u03ba22 \u03ba23 \u03ba13 \u03ba23 \u03ba33 \u23a4 \u23a5\u23a6 (8.14) and only six coef\ufb01cients are needed to specify it (since \u03ba21 = \u03ba12 etc.). Such tensors are called symmetrical. We can further simplify the representation of symmetrical second-rank tensors by transforming it to \u2018\u2018principal axes\u2019\u2019: \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a3 \u03ba1 00 0 \u03ba2 0 00 \u03ba3 \u23a4 \u23a5\u23a6 (8.15) where \u03ba1, \u03ba2,a n d\u03ba 3 are the principal compo- nents. In fact only three numbers are needed to describe the magnitudes of a symmetrical second-rank tensor. The three additional num- bers (e.g., in equation 8.14) relate the tensor to an arbitrary coordinate system. In addition to an analytical expression for ten- sors, a graphical representation is often useful, and we will use such a representation for the discussion of optical properties of minerals (in Chapters 9 and 10). This graphical representation is called a representation quadric (see Box 8.1). Symmetry considerations We have discussed transformations of arbitrary axes (equation 8.13a). For crystals, the axes are de\ufb01ned by symmetry, and we would like to know how symmetry operations apply to physical prop- erties. F.E. Neumann (1885) found that the sym- metry of the property tensor depends on the symmetry of the crystal to which it belongs. In particular, the point-group of a property tensor must include all the symmetry operations of the point-group of the crystal, i.e., any symmetry op- eration that leaves the crystal invariant must leave the property tensor invariant. In Chapter 4 we discussed symmetry opera- tions and the different point-groups of crystals by using graphical representations, such as stereo- graphic projection and crystal morphology. Sym- metry operations can also be dealt with in an analytical way, similar to coordinate transforma- tions, and, for those readers who had dif\ufb01culties in visualizing spherical projections, this analyti- cal procedure may be easier. Box 8.1 Graphical representation of tensor properties In the section above we have described the physical properties of crystals with an array of numbers. These numbers unequivocally de\ufb01ne the material\u2019s response to a stimulus vector. It would be useful for purposes of visualization to have a geometric representation of a property tensor. Consider the equation S ij xi xj = 1 (8.16a) where Sij are coef\ufb01cients. Performing the summation with respect to i and j in equation 8.16a, we obtain S11 x2 1 + S12 x1 x2 + S13 x1 x3 + S21 x2 x1 + S22 x2 2 + S23 x2 x3 + S31 x3 x1 + S32 x3 x2 + S33 x2 3 = 1 (8.16b) and, if Sij = S ji , this simpli\ufb01es", "page": 161}

{"text": "SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS 139 Equation 8.16c is the general equation of a second-degree surface (a quadric), such as an ellipsoid or a hyperboloid. The coef\ufb01cients in equation 8.16a correspond to the components of a second-rank tensor, and we conclude that the quadric can be used to visualize and describe the variation of a crystal property, such as thermal conductivity, with direction. An important property of an ellipsoid is that it has three principal axes at right angles, x i , and when we refer the ellipsoid to those axes equation 8.16c takes the much simpler form S1 x2 1 + S2 x2 2 + S3 x2 3 = 1 (8.16d) where OA = 1/\u221aS1,O B = 1/\u221aS2,O C = 1/\u221aS3 are the lengths of the semi- axes. For most physical properties Sij is positive, de\ufb01nite and the values of the axes are positive. The representation quadric is therefore an ellipsoid rather than a hyperboloid. The length r of any radius vector of the representation quadric is equal to the reciprocal of the square root of the magnitude S of the property in that direction (Figure 8.5): r = 1/\u221aS = 1/\u221a(S 1 cos2 \u03b1 + S2 cos2 \u03b2 + S3 cos2 \u03b3) (8.17) The shape of an ellipsoid is determined by the lengths of the three princi- pal axes, and the orientation of the ellipsoid relative to arbitrary coordinates is given by three angles; hence six numbers are necessary for this general description. An ellipsoid has an intrinsic orthorhombic symmetry with three mirror planes at right angles and 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to each mirror plane (point- group 2/m 2/m 2/m). In special cases it may have a higher symmetry: if OA = OB we obtain a rotational ellipsoid (noncrystallographic point-group\u221e/m), and in the extreme case where OA = OB = OC the ellipsoid degenerates into a sphere (noncrystallographic point-group \u221e/m \u221e/m \u221e/m). A point-group symmetry operation changes the coordinates of a point x1, x2, x3 to x\u2032 1, x\u2032 2, x\u2032 3, which we can represent with a system of three linear transformation equations analogous x1 x2 x3 S3 1 S1 1 S2 1 O \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 r C A A Fig. 8.5 An ellipsoid is the representation quadric for a second-rank tensor.

The vector (x 1, x2, x3), could represent a lat- tice direction and thus apply to the zone indices [uvw], or it could apply to Miller indices (hkl). When it is applied to Miller indices, we \ufb01nd equivalent sets for a 4-fold rotation: ( hkl ), (k \u00afhl), (\u00afh\u00afkl)a n d( \u00afkhl), which is the same result we ob- tain graphically (Figure 8.6). We can apply the same method to a second- rank tensor property by multiplying a symmetry operator with the property tensor to obtain the symmetry-transformed tensor. Instead of arbi- trary coordinate transformations (a ik in equation 8.13a), we substitute a symmetry transformation s ik and sjl and transform the property tensor pkl to a new tensor p\u2032 ij: p\u2032 ij = sik sjl pkl (8.22) For a 2-fold rotation around the z = x3 axis (symmetry operator given by equation 8.20d), by applying equation 8.13b, we obtain (k)( l) p\u2032 ij = (i) \u239b \u239c\u239d \u221210 0 0 \u221210 00 1 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 ( j) \u239b \u239c\u239d \u221210 0 0 \u221210 00 1 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 \u239b \u239c\u239d p11 p12 p13 p12 p22 p23 p13 p23 p33 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 = \u239b \u239c\u239d p11 p12 \u2212p13 p12 p22 \u2212p23 \u2212p13 \u2212p23 p33 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 (8.23) If the symmetry leaves the crystal invariant, it must also leave the property tensor invariant.

Let us look at a second example with a tetrag- onal crystal and a 4-fold rotation axis on z (equa- tion 8.20e). We again use equation 8.13b: p\u2032 ij = \u239b \u239c\u239d 010 \u2212100 001 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 \u239b \u239c\u239d 010 \u2212100 001 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 \u239b \u239c\u239d p11 p12 p13 p12 p22 p23 p13 p23 p33 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 = \u239b \u239c\u239d p22 \u2212p21 p23 \u2212p12 p11 \u2212p13 p32 \u2212p31 p33 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 (8.24) As far as the diagonal components are concerned, this is satis\ufb01ed only if p11 and p22 are equal. Fur- thermore, for the off-diagonal elements, the cor- respondence between symmetrically related com- ponents is maintained only if they are zero. Thus the tensor for this tetragonal crystal becomes very simple, containing only two independent components: \u239b \u239c\u239d p11 00 0 p11 0 00 p33 \u239e \u239f\u23a0 for a 4-fold axis parallel to z. The point-group of a property tensor must in- clude all the symmetry operations of the point- group of the crystal, i.e., any symmetry operation of the crystal must leave the property tensor in- variant. This was illustrated for both a 2-fold and a 4-fold rotation. Table 8.1 summarizes the re- strictions of crystal symmetry on the second-rank property tensor. In a cubic crystal a single coef- \ufb01cient describes the property, and in a triclinic crystal six coef\ufb01cients are necessary to describe a property. This is shown graphically in Figure 8.7, with x, y, z representing crystal axes and x \u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032 the axes of the property ellipsoid.

In a monoclinic crystal at least one axis of the ellipsoid has to be parallel to the 2- fold symmetry axis y of the crystal (Figure 8.7b). In orthorhombic crystals all ellipsoid axes have to be parallel to the crystallographic axes (Figure 8.7c). In tetragonal, hexagonal, and trig- onal crystals, the only ellipsoid that is compati- ble with 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotation axes is a rota- tional ellipsoid with the unique axis oriented par- allel to the crystallographic z-axis (Figure 8.7d). Finally in cubic crystals the ellipsoid degenerates to a sphere (Figure 8.7e). In a sphere a property has the same value in all directions, and cubic crystals are therefore isotropic for second-rank ten- sor properties. To summarize this discussion of the symme- try of physical properties, we state that no matter what the tensor rank is, all point-group symme- try elements that are present in the crystal (ro- tations, mirror planes, and inversions) must be present in the property tensor.

Unless they are restricted by crystal symmetry, second-rank tensors are spec- i\ufb01ed by nine numbers (3 2). (We have seen ear- lier that for symmetrical second-rank tensors this is reduced to six.) Vectors can also be viewed as tensors, but of the \ufb01rst rank, and are de- scribed by three numbers (3 1), as shown in equa- tion 8.3. Scalars (such as density) are sometimes referred to as tensors of zero rank and are de- scribed by a single number (3 0). There are also tensors of higher order. For example, the elas- tic compliance S ijk l is a fourth-rank tensor that relates stress (stimulus) and strain (response). It requires 81 (3 4) components for its description. As we will see, not all of these components are independent. The rank of a tensor physical property de- pends on the quantity of stimulus and response that it relates. The relationship between two scalars (e.g., mass and volume) is a scalar property (density). The relationship between two vectors (e.g., thermal gradient and heat \ufb02ow) is a second- rank tensor (thermal conductivity). Two second- rank tensors (e.g., stress and strain) are re- lated by a fourth-rank tensor (elastic compliance). Whereas the representation quadric for a sym- metrical second-rank tensor is an ellipsoid, those for higher-rank tensors are more complicated sur- faces, some of which will be illustrated in later sections. Table 8.2 gives examples of properties that will be reviewed brie\ufb02y in this chapter.

We can then calculate the density: \u03c1 = m/V = 4 \u00d7 (3.82 + 5.89) \u00d7 10\u221223g/(5.639 \u00d7 10\u22128cm)3 = 2.17g/cm3 (8.27) Water Water 0 0 WWWa \u0394W (a) (b) Fig. 8.8 Schematic of a Jolly balance, used to measure speci\ufb01c gravity by determining (a) the relative weight of a sample in air (Wa) and (b) the relative weight of the sample immersed in water (Ww). Since the volume of most materials increases slightly with temperature, whereas the mass re- mains constant, the density decreases slightly with increasing temperature. Similarly, since the volume decreases with pressure, the density in- creases with pressure. Thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and specific heat We have already introduced thermal conductivity in equation 8.4 as q =\u2212 \u03ba\u2207T . It is relatively high for metals and minerals with substantial contri- butions of metallic bonding, such as graphite, where heat is transferred largely through the \ufb02ow of free electrons. For ionic and covalent crys- tals, thermal conductivity is much lower and of- ten strongly anisotropic. In these crystals heat is transferred through thermal vibrations. Over- all, the thermal conductivity is greatest in direc- tions of closer atomic packing. Graphite, with a layer structure, has a thermal conductivity that is four times higher within the layers with partial metallic bonding than perpendicular to them.

Thermal expansion \u03b1 ij is also a second-rank tensor, relating a temperature increment /Delta1T (a scalar) with a strain \u03b5ij (a second-rank tensor): \u03b5ij = \u03b1ij /Delta1T (8.28) I fas p h e r ew e r ed r a w ni nt h ec r y s t a li tw o u l d become, on change of temperature, an ellip- soid with axes proportional to (1 + \u03b1 1 /Delta1T ), (1 + \u03b12 /Delta1T )a n d( 1 + \u03b13 /Delta1T ). Normally crystals ex- pand in all directions with increasing temper- ature, as is the case for quartz (Figure 8.9a). But calcite is different and expands parallel to the c-axis, yet contracts perpendicular to it (Figure 8.9b). The abnormal behavior and high anisotropy of thermal expansion for calcite is the reason that, in calcite rocks such as mar- ble, large local stresses are produced during ther- mal cycling, leading to fracturing and deterio- ration, reducing their suitability as a building material. Thermal expansion of single crystals is generally measured by determining lattice parameter changes with temperature by X-ray diffraction. Values for heat capacity (or speci\ufb01c heat), C p, are given in Table 8.4. The de\ufb01ning equation of this scalar property is /Delta1S = (C /T ) /Delta1T (8.29) where /Delta1S is the entropy change, /Delta1T a tempera- ture change and T the absolute temperature (for further discussion, see Chapter 17). Elastic properties So far we have discussed some scalars and second- rank tensors. We now survey brie\ufb02y a more complex property, elasticity, which expresses a unique relationship between two second-rank tensors: stress (\u03c3 ) and elastic strain (\u03b5 ). It is rep- resented by a fourth-rank tensor. 14% 9% 25% 5.6% (a) (b) Fig. 8.9 Due to anisotropic thermal expansion a spherical crystal deforms into an ellipsoid upon heating.

The resulting ellipsoid is called the deformation,o rstrain ellipsoid (or stretch ellipsoid by the mechanical community) with axes \u03bb1, \u03bb2, and \u03bb3 (Figure 8.11a). There may or may not be a volume change accompanying this deformation. Notice that some diameters are stretched (ellip- soid surface outside the sphere whereas others are compressed. Figure 8.11b illustrates, for two- dimensional deformation (plane strain), shape changes during increasing deformation, keeping the volume constant. As a general statement of elastic behavior, Hooke\u2019s law states that deformation, or strain, imposed by a stress is proportional to that stress. This can be extended into a linear relation- ship between the six independent components of stress ( \u03c3 ij) and the six independent components of elastic strain (\u03b5 kl), both symmetrical tensors (Cauchy\u2019s law).

These equations can be written in matrix form as \u03c3ij = cijkl \u03b5kl (8.32a) or, alternatively, as \u03b5ij = sijkl \u03c3kl (8.32b) The fourth-rank tensor cijkl is called the elastic stiffness (or elastic constant), and the tensor sijkl is called the elastic compliance (or elastic modulus). A fourth-rank tensor has in general 81 (3 4)i n d e - pendent components, but this is reduced to 36 owing to the symmetry of the stress tensor\u03c3 ij and the strain tensor \u03b5kl. Furthermore, for thermo- dynamic reasons the elastic tensor is \u2018\u2018symmetri- cal\u201d and this reduces the number of independent components to 21. Further reductions are due to crystal symmetry. The most generally anisotropic solid, with triclinic symmetry, has 21 indepen- dent elastic components; this reduces for crystals with cubic symmetry to 3, and for an isotropic medium (such as amorphous glass) to 2 (Table 8.5).

As with a second-rank tensor, the directional properties of the fourth-rank elastic tensor can also be visualized as a surface. For the stiffness this surface is more complex than an ellip- soid, and even for cubic crystals it is generally anisotropic. For a given crystal the shape of the surface has to conform to the crystal symmetry. The anisotropy (ratio between largest and small- est value) can be large, as in the case of gold (Figure 8.12a), or much smaller, as for aluminum (Figure 8.12b). Tungsten is almost isotropic.

Seismologists use travel times of these waves as they pass through the earth to decipher elastic properties of the planet\u2019s deep interior. From the elastic constants we can calculate ve- locities.

If olivine crystals are aligned, as they often are in deformed rocks, the propagation of elastic waves in the aggregate is also anisotropic (e.g., Kocks et al., 2000). Seismologists have established that the preferred orientation of olivine in peri- dotites of the upper mantle of the earth, which was produced during convection, causes the ob- served anisotropy of seismic waves (Silver, 1996). For example in the oceanic mantle underneath Hawaii, there is an azimuthal variation in P -wave velocities of over 10% (Figure 8.15). Piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity In crystals that lack an inversion center, there is an absolute directionality, at least for some axes. The lack of symmetry is a condition for the occurrence of such properties as optical ac- tivity (which will be discussed brie\ufb02y in Chapter 9), piezoelectricity (from the Greek /H9266/H9259\u00b4\u03b5/H9256\u03b5/H9259\u03bd(piezein), meaning press), and pyroelectricity (from the Greek /H9266\u02c6/H9271/H9267(pur), meaning \ufb01re). Crystals with a center of symmetry do not display these properties. The piezoelectric effect can be described as follows. If an electric \ufb01eld E is applied to cer- tain noncentric crystals, the shape of the crystal changes slightly, i.e., a strain \u03b5 is produced. \u03b5jk = dijk E i (8.34) E i is a vector component and \u03b5jk a second-rank tensor; therefore, the piezoelectricity is a third- r a n kt e n s o r .T h i se f f e c ta l s ow o r k si nr e v e r s e :B y", "page": 171}

Pierre Curie \ufb01rst observed piezoelectricity in 1880. The structure of quartz contains spiraling chains of SiO 4\u2212 4 tetrahedra parallel to the c-axis. In projection they appear as six-membered and three-membered rings of tetrahedra. The three- membered rings are more relevant in this discus- sion, and one such ring, with Si and O, is shown schematically in Figure 8.16a, which also displays the a-axes. In the undeformed crystal structure, charges of O 2\u2212 and Si4+ are balanced. However, if a slab of a quartz crystal cut parallel to the c-axis is stressed parallel to an a-axis, the charges are displaced and an electric \ufb01eld is induced with a surplus of negative charges on one side and of positive charges on the other (Figure 8.16b). And vice versa, we can apply an oscillating electric \ufb01eld to a quartz crystal and produce mechanical vibrations. There is a wide range of technological appli- cations for piezoelectricity. In transducers and pressure sensors, an applied pressure produces an electric \ufb01eld that is then ampli\ufb01ed and mea- sured. Mechanical vibrations, such as those from old phonograph needles, have been recorded with quartz crystals and transformed into an electric signal. The inverse effect has applications for the precise timing of quartz watches and for tuning radio signals.

In radios, only signals that match the quartz oscil- lations are ampli\ufb01ed, enabling \ufb01ne-tuning. The representation quadric of this third-rank piezoelectric tensor has a rather odd shape, with three lobes along the positive a-axes and a zero value in most other directions, as illustrated in Figure 8.17a,b. Another unusual property is pyroelectricity, which had already been observed by Theophras- tus. When prismatic tourmaline crystals (point- group 3m ) are heated, opposite ends develop an opposite electric charge. A. Kundt (1883) dusted a heated tourmaline crystal with a mixture of sul- fur and lead oxide powder. Owing to friction the powder particles were charged, negative for yel- low sulfur and positive for red lead oxide. Positive sulfur collected on one end of the crystal and lead on the opposite end, illustrating the effect (Figure 8.18). Pyroelectricity, a vector property, is only possible in crystals with unique polar axes (Table 8.6).

For example, in fayalite (iron-olivine, Fe 2SiO4), iron ions have a magnetic moment but moments are randomly aligned. When placed in a magnetic \ufb01eld, moments of Fe 2+ will tend to align in parallel to the \ufb01eld, but as soon as the \ufb01eld is removed, thermal motion randomizes the dipoles. The magnetic suscepti- bility varies with crystal structure and composi- tion and, on the whole, increases with increas- ing numbers of unpaired electrons. This mag- netic property is made use of to separate a grain aggregate of different minerals with an electro- magnet, both in the laboratory and in mining operations. In ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic crystals, mag- netic dipoles are aligned as described above for MnO. In ferromagnetic bcc iron the dipoles are aligned in parallel, whereas in ferrimagnetic MnO the dipoles alternate in opposite direc- tions. Ideally, in ferrimagnetic materials, mag- netic moments cancel.

In the case of magnetite (Figure 8.20b) the domain bound- aries are determined by the microstructure. In other magnetic materials they depend simply on dipole alignment (Bloch walls) and are mobile. When a magnetic \ufb01eld is applied, domain walls move and change their morphology to minimize the energy. This is illustrated in Figure 8.21 for a synthetic oxide and here imaged with a polariz- ing light microscope. In ferromagnetic bcc iron the magnetic moments in domains may be var- iously oriented parallel to \u27e8100\u27e9, \u27e8110\u27e9,o r\u27e8111 \u27e9. No particular direction is preferred, and thus the structure is overall magnetically disordered and its resultant magnetic moment is zero. How- ever, in a strong magnetic \ufb01eld, those domains with dipoles parallel to the \ufb01eld will grow and the crystal becomes magnetic. The magnetic sus- ceptibility of ferromagnetic crystals is extremely high. It is not simply a material property, but also depends greatly on the applied magnetic \ufb01eld. If a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic crystal is heated, the strength of magnetization gradually decreases. At a temperature known as the Curie temperature, all the coupling between magnetic dipoles is lost due to intense thermal vibrations and the crystal becomes paramagnetic. In the", "page": 175}

{"text": "Chapter 9 Optical properties Some physical background Optical properties are a striking expression of the anisotropic internal structure of minerals. The best way to convince yourself that this is true is to examine a thin section of a rock (a 20--30 /H9262m thick slice, see Chapter 10) in a petrographic mi- croscope with polarized light and compare the ef- fects with those from a plain glass slide. The glass slide appears dull black, whereas the rock, com- posed of crystals, displays an intricate color pat- tern that changes as the thin section is rotated (see e.g., Plates 2 and 3). The change in optical properties with orientation highlights anisotropy of crystals. Indeed, the interaction of light with crystals is directional, and this lends itself to a so- phisticated microscopical analysis that is widely used by mineralogists and petrologists. The opti- cal properties of minerals are characteristic and serve for mineral identi\ufb01cation. The subject of optical mineralogy is extensive and is dealt with in many excellent books (for a partial listing, see \u2018\u2018Further reading\u2019\u2019 at the end of this chap- ter). Here we provide merely a brief overview of the most important principles of crystal optics to help in understanding some of the optical fea- tures of minerals. This discussion is followed in Chapter 10 by an introduction on how to analyze minerals with a petrographic microscope. Like X-rays (see Chapter 7), visible light is elec- tromagnetic radiation resulting from the interac- tion of an oscillating electric \ufb01eld E and an oscil- lating magnetic \ufb01eld H (Figure 9.1). The sources of E are electric charges, present as electrons and protons in matter. The electric \ufb01eld diverges from all charges and becomes the source of a magnetic \ufb01eld that compensates for the \ufb02owing current (Figure 9.l, left side). Magnetic and electric \ufb01elds constantly create one another and spread at a ve- locity c, the speed at which light propagates in a vacuum (300 000 km/s). We have seen in Chapter 7 that electromagnetic waves have a sinusoidal shape ( y = Asin \u03c9t). These waves are character- ized by amplitude A and wavelength \u03bb, with the electric \ufb01eld E at right angles to the correspond- ing magnetic \ufb01eld H and displaced by a quarter of a wavelength (Figure 9.1, right side) (see also Figure 7.4 for a de\ufb01nition of wave properties). Visible light constitutes a small segment of the large spectrum of electromagnetic radiation that ranges from short, high-energy \u03b3-rays (l0 \u22126 nm) to long radio waves (1012--1017 nm = l--105 km) (Figure 9.2). Only wavelengths of 400--800 nm cause a photochemical reaction in the retina of the human eye, which is registered by the brain according to intensity and wavelength. Monochromatic light consists of one single wavelength, for example the sodium D line produced by a sodium vapor lamp. If all wave- lengths of the visible spectrum are present with equal intensity, a situation that is approached in sunlight, the human brain interprets this visible radiation as white.

Depending on the optical effect being con- sidered, we will emphasize either the particle or the wave character of light in what follows. Refractive index and the petrographic microscope When we insert a thin slab of a crystal into a beam of light, the primary electric \ufb01eld of the light interacts with the local electric \ufb01eld caused by electrons and protons in the crystal. Photons propagate at the speed of light but are de\ufb02ected in the crystal and thus travel on different paths. A path of a photon passing through a vacuum (Figure 9.3a) is compared with a photon path go- ing through a crystal (Figure 9.3b). An observer of the resultant light ray will notice a time delay for those rays that passed through matter. This is not due to any change in the fundamental velocity c but rather to increased path length produced by internal scattering on electrons within the crys- t a l .T h en e te f f e c ti sa na p p a r e n t l ys l o w e rp r o p - agation of light in matter compared to its speed of propagation in a vacuum. The velocity ratio of vacuum (c ) and medium (v ), n = c/v, is called the refractive index of the material. It is a measure of the interaction between light and electrons, which increases with the number of electrons per unit volume and thus, in general, with the density. Table 9.1 gives some typical values of refractive indices. Notice that for some mate- rials the refractive index is a single number, but for most crystals it varies with direction, as indicated by the range of values. We also \ufb01nd that the refractive index is a function of wavelength and of external conditions such as temperature. Since most condensed matter has a refractive index considerably larger than 1.0 (vacuum by de\ufb01nition), light changes direction as it enters from air, with a refractive index close to that of vacuum, into a mineral with a much higher re- fractive index. Snell\u2019s law, which is applied exten- sively in mineral optics, describes this behavior (Box 9.1).

By the time wave 3 has reached the surface at B, a new wave front, BD has developed at t = 2 as a tangential plane to the elementary spherical wavelets.

(c) The irregular scattering can be minimized by embedding minerals in a cement or oil with a similar refractive index, such as Canada balsam, and then covering the sample with a glass slide with a perfectly \ufb02at surface. A special case of Snell\u2019s law is normal incidence (Figure 9.5a). In this case no change in direction occurs, even if the refractive indices of the two media are vastly different. This fact is crucial for the observation of crystals in a microscope. Rough surfaces disperse light in all directions (Figure 9.5b). T o minimize refraction and dispersion, mechanically ground thin sections of a rock, used in mineralogical analysis, are embedded in Canada balsam, a natural resin, and covered with a glass slide, both of which have refractive indices more similar to that of the crystal than to that of air (Figure 9.5c).

{"text": "REFRACTIVE INDEX AND THE PETROGRAPHIC MICROSCOPE 161 T otal re\ufb02ection, Abbe refractometer Another special case of Snell\u2019s law occurs when light passes from a medium with a higher refractive index (n1) into one with a lower refractive index (n2) and at some critical incident angle \u03b1c the refraction angle \u03b2 becomes 90\u25e6 or larger ((sin \u03b1c/ sin 90\u25e6) = n2/n1) (Figure 9.6a). In this case no light enters the second medium but is instead completely re\ufb02ected. The limiting angle of total re\ufb02ection, \u03b1c, is a convenient way to measure the refractive index of liquids and polished surfaces. Such measurements are carried out in the Abbe refractometer (Figure 9.6b). It consists of a half-cylindrical piece of glass with a known refractive index N, on which is mounted a crystal or a drop of liquid with an unknown refractive n2 < n1 n1 \u03b1c \u03b1 n2 n1 = sin \u03b1c (a) Incident Reflected Refracted n2 (b) n 1 2 3 4 55 4 3 2 1 \u03b1c \u03b11 N 3 Bright21 index n. In this instrument the re\ufb02ected light is observed with a telescope. In general, some light will be refracted and some re\ufb02ected (rays 1 and 2), but if the incident angle \u03b1 reaches the critical value \u03b1 c all light will be re\ufb02ected (ray 3) and the observed light intensity will suddenly increase. The \ufb01eld of view at this angle is symmetrically divided into a brighter (rays 3\u20135) and a darker (rays 1\u20133) area. From \u03b1 c we obtain the refraction index:n = Nsin \u03b1c (since \u03b2 = 90\u25e6, and thus sin\u03b2 = 1, when \u03b1 = \u03b1c). Prisms and lenses Another application of refraction is the prism, with which the path of light can be changed. In a prism with two \ufb02at faces, inclined by an angle \u03b3, Snell\u2019s law applies twice, to the entering and to the leaving light rays, causing a de\ufb02ection of the light Fig. 9.6 (a) Snell\u2019s law for total re\ufb02ection. If the incident angle \u03b1 is at a critical value \u03b1c, or larger, no light enters the crystal with refractive index n2. (b) The principle of total re\ufb02ection is applied in the Abbe refractometer, used to measure refractive indices of oils and crystal surfaces. A crystal or drop of liquid with refractive indexn is mounted on a glass half-cylinder with refractive index N. For rays 1 and 2, some light is refracted and some is re\ufb02ected. Ray 3 is at the critical angle \u03b1 c and for this, as well as all rays with larger incident angles (rays 4 and 5), all light is re\ufb02ected, resulting in a bright re\ufb02ection signal for rays 3\u20135, compared to a darker signal for rays 1\u20133.

If white light is transmitted through a glass prism, it divides light into a rainbow spectrum (Figure 9.7b), illustrating that the refractive index is not constant but depends on wavelength. This effect is known as dispersion. The principle of the prism is applied in the construction of lenses, which can be regarded as a set of prisms with a special geometry such that parallel incident light rays are de\ufb02ected so that they all pass through a point F (Figure 9.7c). In a continuous lens (Figure 9.8a) all light that is initially parallel to the optical axis (the central normal to the median plane of the lens) is refracted to cross the optical axis at point F 1 (ray 1). Similarly, all light rays that are parallel to the optical axis after passing through the lens have passed a point F2 before entering the lens (ray 2). These points (F1 and F2) are called focal points and are at distances f1 and f2, Fig. 9.7 (a) Geometry of a prism with double refraction.

{"text": "REFRACTIVE INDEX AND THE PETROGRAPHIC MICROSCOPE 163 respectively, from the median plane of the lens. The focal length f is a measure of the strength of the lens. With a short focus lens it is possible to converge light very effectively. We can use this construction to obtain the image I from an object O, whose respective heights are illustrated by the vertical arrows in Figure 9.8a. Ray 1, going through the tip of the O arrow, is parallel to the optical axis. It therefore passes through F 1 after refraction. Ray 2, which also goes through the tip of the O arrow, passes through F2 and is thus parallel to the optical axis after refraction. The intersection of the two rays de\ufb01nes the tip of the image I r. A third ray, 3, passing through the center of the lens, is not refracted. The image I r can be recorded on a photographic \ufb01lm mounted at I r or viewed on an inserted sheet of paper, documenting that it is real. If an object is too close to the lens, i.e., within the focal point F2, the strength of the lens is insuf\ufb01cient to converge light rays enough to produce an image (Figure 9.8b). The lens will, however, reduce the divergence between ray 1 and ray 2 and we can construct a virtual image I v by intersection of the back extensions of the rays. This upright image cannot be recorded on a screen, but it can be transformed into a real image, for example by application of a second lens that, in combination with the \ufb01rst, increases the convergence. A lens often applied to record virtual images is the human eye. This ideal geometry is only approximated in real lenses. There are two signif- icant limitations. First, because of spherical aberration, the ideal lens geometry is generally satis\ufb01ed only for light rays that are close to the center of the lens (Figure 9.9a). By inserting an aperture and selecting only the inner rays, overall light is re- duced, but resolution of the image is increased. Chromatic aberration is due to the fact that different wavelengths have different refractive indices, with slightly different focal points for different colors (Figure 9.9b). Both aberrations can be minimized by constructing composite lenses in which the selection of glasses with different refractive indices compensates for these effects. and brightness are provided by the objective lens; the ocular lens contributes only magni\ufb01cation. Thus it is customary to work with high objective lens magni\ufb01cation (2.5, 10, 25, 50\u00d7) and lower oc- ular magni\ufb01cation (2, 4, l0\u00d7) to achieve optimal conditions. A modern petrographic microscope (Figure 9.10b and c) has more analytical features than those described above.The sample is mounted on a rotating stage. Light is emitted from a tungsten \ufb01lament lamp, collected and condensed on the transparent object by a condenser lens system to achieve either a parallel incidence of light on the object or, for special applications, a convergent incidence.

A \ufb01rst aperture is placed below the condenser lens to decrease spherical aberration and increase depth of focus, but this has the effect of reducing over- all brightness. A second aperture in the object image plane restricts the area of the specimen viewed. The microscope axis is the central direc- tion passing through the center of all lenses. (In modern microscopes this is not always a straight line!) In petrographic microscopes two polarizing \ufb01lters, the polarizer and the analyzer, are inserted. There is also a place to add what is known as a compensator. Finally an auxiliary lens, called the Bertrand lens, is used for some applications.

Polarization and birefringence Polarization In 1669 the Danish scientist Erasmus Bartholinus made a very puzzling observation. If a beam of light (and today it is easiest to use a laser for this experiment) is aimed at a calcite cleavage face (10\u00af14) at normal incidence and penetrates a slab of some thickness, the signal splits into two components (Figure 9.11a). One component obeys Snell\u2019s law (i.e., there is no de\ufb02ection because of normal incidence), but the other one does not. The experiment suggests that there are two re- fractive indices in crystals, causing birefringence. Using a polarizing \ufb01lter that only allows light to pass that vibrates in a certain direction, we can determine that the two light waves leaving the crystal are polarized and vibrate perpendicular to each other. If we observe an image, such as a label underneath a calcite crystal, we see two images (Figure 9.11b). These results indicate that the interaction of light and crystals is far more complicated than previously assumed. In order to understand polarization, we have to consider light as a wave. In general the oscillation of the electric \ufb01eld has a random orientation normal to the propagation direction (illustrated by waves in three planes at different angles in Figure 9.12a). If the oscillation is con- \ufb01ned to a single plane, we call such light polarized (Figure 9.12b). We will call the direction in which the light oscillates the vibration direction.

If unpolarized light is transmitted through such a crystal, only waves vibrating in one direction are permitted to pass. This direction-dependent absorption is due to different bonding forces in different crystal directions. There are other crystals, and among them many minerals, that show direction-dependent absorption, but this absorption is less complete and removes only cer- tain wavelengths from the spectrum, resulting in color changes as the crystal is rotated in polar- ized light.

In Figure 9.13a, this wave is shown in a three-dimensional representation. In the crystal the polarized wave P splits into two waves, each traveling with a different velocity v (and, correspondingly, with a different refractive index n). The two waves on plane 1 and plane 2 are polarized perpendicular to one another. In Figure 9.13b the two waves are shown separately in the planes in which they are polarized, which illustrates a change in wavelength inside the crys- tal (\u03bb 1 and \u03bb2, and correspondingly refractive in- dices n1 and n2).

The two waves are separate, vibrating in different planes, and there is no interaction between them. However, wave interference can be obtained if they are forced to vibrate in the same plane. This is done in the petrographic mi- croscope by inserting a second polarizing \ufb01lter above the crystal (see Figure 9.10b) that lets only those components of waves pass through that are parallel to the \ufb01lter direction (Figure 9.13, right side). Since we use this polarizer to analyze in- terference effects, it is customarily called an an- alyzer. Polarizer (P) and analyzer (A) can have parallel vibrations (plane polarizers), but more of- ten their vibration directions are perpendicular to one another (crossed polarizers). In Figure 9.13 the case is shown for crossed polarizers. Coherence is another condition necessary for interference. Light waves generally arrive in short strings, extending over several wavelengths. In- teraction between such strings (or light pulses) produces only incoherent scattering. However, in the case discussed here, coherence is satis\ufb01ed, be- cause both component waves originated from the same wave packet and were originally in phase. As was shown in Figure 7.5 for X-rays, there are two limiting cases for interference of waves: if two interfering waves are in phase (minima and maxima of the sinusoidal curves line up), then the resultant wave is strongly enforced (see also Figure 9.14a). If the waves are out of phase (the minima of one wave line up with the maxima of the other), addition of the two waves causes extinction (Figure 9.14b). Before investigating the effects of crystal thickness on interference, let us \ufb01rst examine the effects of crystal orientation. Assume that a crystal slab is placed in the light path and that the polarizer (P) and analyzer (A) are paral- lel (parallel polarizers; Figure 9.15a--c is a view in the propagation direction, corresponding to Fig- ure 9.13c). While examining Figure 9.15, keep in mind Figure 9.13a for the three-dimensional per- spective. In the polarizer P, light vibrates in the horizontal direction (shown by a solid arrow, rep- resenting the light vector). In the crystal slab, the original light vector splits into two components, X and Z , which we construct by projecting the original light vector on the two perpendicular (a) Parallel polarizers Crossed polarizers (b) \u03bb/2 Fig. 9.14 Interference of two monochromatic light waves (solid and dashed sinusoidal waves) to produce a resultant wave (dotted line).

Note that both of these re- sultant vectors are pointing in the same direc- tion and would add, if the two waves were in phase (Figure 9.14a). As we rotate the crystal, the lengths of the projected vector components of X and Z change (Figure 9.15a--c). Special cases arise when either X or Z are parallel to the polarizer and analyzer (Figure 9.15c). In these cases there is no contribution from one vibration (X in the case shown) and a maximum contribution from the second ( Z in the \ufb01gure). There is no in\ufb02uence of birefringence and light passes through, irrespec- tive of crystal thickness and wavelength. For all other rotations (Figure 9.15a,b) the interference equation 9.3 applies. If the path difference pro- duced in the crystal by birefringence is zero, or a multiple of the wavelength \u0394 = (m\u03bb), where m is an integer, then there is positive interference (Figure 9.14a).", "page": 191}

A polarized light vector P (solid arrow) splits into two perpendicular vibrations, X and Z, in the crystal (dashed arrows) that differ depending on the rotation of the crystal (a\u2013c and d\u2013f). The vectors 1 and 2 resolved in the analyzer A (labeled A 1 and A2) are shown as dot\u2013dashed arrows. This \ufb01gure is analogous to Figure 9.13c. In (a) and (d) vibration directions are in an arbitrary orientation relative to the polarizer, in (b) and (e) they are at 45 \u25e6 and in (c) and (f) they are parallel. The effect of crystal orientation on the re- sultant light vector becomes particularly clear if the polarizer and analyzer are at right angles (crossed polarizers,a l s or e f e r r e dt oa s\u2018 \u2018crossed po- lars\u2019\u2019, Figure 9.15d--f). The projection of the hor- izontal polarized light vector P i st h es a m ea s before, but now we need to project vibration di- rections X and Z onto the vertical analyzer A (dot--dashed vectors). Note that in the case of crossed polarizers the two component vectors 1 and 2 are always opposite in sign, and vibrate in opposite directions. If there is no birefrin- gence, or no crystal thickness, the two waves are out of phase (Figure 9.14b) and no light passes. We can verify this simply by removing the crys- tal from the microscope, essentially producing zero thickness and therefore zero path difference (equation 9.3b), and observing darkness for crossed polarizers. For a crystal with a path differ- ence there is interference in the analyzer plane, but the crossing of polarizer and analzyer have effectively added for crossed polarizers a path dif- ference of half a wavelength, relative to the case of parallel polarizers (Figure 9.14a versus b). In the case of crossed polarizers interference is op- timal at \u0394 = (m\u03bb) + \u03bb/2, where m is an integer.

There are dark (destructive interference, shaded) and light (constructive interference, black) bands that have the color of the light used, i.e., blue (a, c) and red (b, d). The bands are spaced more closely for blue light than for red light. (Figure 9.15f), the light vector is fully resolved on one vibration direction, i.e., the projection coin- cides with the vector ( Z in this case). But there is no projection component from the other vi- bration direction ( X), and the projection of Z on the analyzer direction is zero. This results in ex- tinction, whether or not an optical retardation develops. As we rotate a crystal on the micro- scope stage a full turn, it goes into extinction four times, whenever a vibration direction is par- allel or perpendicular to the polarizer. In the 45 \u25e6 position (Figure 9.15e), a maximum amount of light passes, provided there is a path difference, and this position is used for evaluating interfer- ence effects. We now return to equation 9.3b and summa- rize our \ufb01ndings. For plane-polarized light we have maximum constructive interference for zero path difference or an integer multiple of the wave- length. For crossed polarizers we have maximum constructive interference for \u03bb/2 path difference or a multiple of wavelengths plus half a wave- length. Next we are going to explore the effect of crystal thickness. Consider what happens if monochromatic light passes through a wedge- shaped crystal between parallel polarizers and the crystal is oriented such that the vibration di- rections are at 45 \u25e6 to polarizer and analyzer. We observe a pattern of alternating colored and dark bands, each corresponding to a path difference of one wavelength and thus a thickness difference d = \u0394/(n1 \u2212 n2) (Figure 9.16a,b). The \ufb01rst colored band (black in the \ufb01gure) is at zero thickness, the second one at \u03bb, then 2\u03bb etc. For short wave- lengths (e.g., blue, Figure 9.16a) the bands are more closely spaced than for larger wavelengths (e.g., red, Figure 9.16b). For crossed polarizers the pattern is similar, except that it has shifted by half a wavelength and in this case the band at zero thickness is dark and the \ufb01rst colored band is at 1 2 \u03bb (Figure 9.16c,d). For most routine analyses with a petrographic microscope, crossed polarizers are used rather than parallel polarizers and in the following dis- cussion we will emphasize this case. We have looked at interference effects with monochro- matic light and studied the in\ufb02uence of crys- tal orientation, thickness d, birefringence ( n 1 \u2212 n2) and wavelength \u03bb.

For a retardation of 700 nm red and orange are extinct, but second- order blue is present, resulting in a blue inter- ference color. For even larger thicknesses with many extinctions and maximum intensities, the resultant light has many color contributions and resembles white again. The color pattern produced by the linear ef- fects of thickness and birefringence is shown in Plate 1a. There is a distinct interference color for each path difference (optical retardation) \u0394 = d(n\u2032 \u03b1 -- n\u2032 \u03b3 ). Interference color charts, such as the one in Figure 9.18 and Plate 1a, are usually represented as a plot of thickness versus retar- dation and the birefringence is a straight line in this space. Some mineral examples are illus- trated. If the thickness is known, we can use the interference color to determine the birefringence that can be applied in mineral identi\ufb01cation with the petrographic microscope, as we will see in Chapter 10. Note that the color chart has been divided into different orders; each contains some shades of yellow, red, etc. With some practice you will be able to distinguish colors on sight. Low- order colors are very distinct, higher orders are more \u2018\u2018washed out\u201d, with pastel shades. The term \u2018\u2018interference color\u2019\u2019 is somewhat misleading. Wave groups of different wave- lengths in white light are not coherent and show no regular interference. The interference color is a mixture of waves with different wavelengths whose intensity has been modi\ufb01ed by interfer- ence effects. The optical indicatrix In the discussion above, we established that light passing through a crystal vibrates in two different directions in most crystals and there are two refractive indices for each vibration direc- tion. However, this behavior is different in differ- ent crystal directions. How can we visualize the variations of refraction indices with direction? To answer this question, we \ufb01rst perform a hypothet- ical experiment: we place a light source within a crystal and turn it on for an instant to explore how far light pulses have advanced. We \ufb01nd that the distances the light pulses have traveled de- scribe the surface of an ellipsoid centered on the light source (Figure 9.19a). For those of you who have followed the discus- sion in Chapter 8, this pattern is due to the in- trinsic physical properties of crystals. Interaction of light with a crystal is described by the relation- ship between two vector properties: a stimulus of electric \ufb01eld E, and a response as an electric dis- placement D: Di = \u03b5ij E j (9.4) where \u03b5ij is the so-called dielectric constant, which is closely related to the refractive in- dex and is a second-rank tensor. The refrac- tive index ellipsoid is simply the representation quadric of \u03b5 \u22121, the inverse of the dielectric ten- sor. All parameters specifying the ellipsoid can be derived from \u03b5. Three numbers are needed to describe the lengths of the axes,", "page": 195}

All other sections are general sections and the ellipse has axis lengths n \u2032 \u03b1 and n\u2032 \u03b3 , where n\u03b1 < n\u2032 \u03b1 < n\u2032 \u03b3 < n\u03b3 . An important principal section is that perpen- dicular to Y (n\u03b2).

All other sections have lower-order colors. Now consider sections that contain Y (corre- sponding to n \u03b2) as one axis (Figure 9.20). On top is a perspective drawing showing the orientation of the ellipsoid sections. Below it, the individual ellipses are shown. In the \ufb01rst section (1) n \u03b3 and n\u03b2 are axes of the ellipse. As we tilt around n\u03b2 towards n\u03b1, the long axis gets shorter and the ellipse has n\u2032 \u03b3 and n\u03b2 as axes (2). Tilting further we come to a point where n\u2032 \u03b3 has the same length as n\u03b2 (3). An ellipse with two equal axes degen- erates into a circle and we call this a circular section. In this case the two waves propagating perpendicular to it have the same velocity and do not attain a path difference. This means that in this direction light will be extinct if observed through crossed polarizers, no matter what the rotation angle of the crystal or its thickness is. We continue to tilt aroundn \u03b2 but now the second axis is shorter than n\u03b2 and thus is n\u2032 \u03b1.F i n a l l yw e arrive at another principal section with n\u03b1 and n\u03b2 as axes (5). In general, there are two such circular sec- tions in an ellipsoid, symmetrically between n\u03b1 and n\u03b3 , and containing n\u03b2. They are shown with shading in Figure 9.19d and as dashed traces in Figure 9.19e. The directions perpendicular to these circular sections are called optic axes (labeled A and B ), and the plane containing A and B is called the axial plane (AP). In Figure 9.19e the axial plane section containing the two optic axes is shown. In this section we \ufb01nd A, B , X (n \u03b1) and Z (n\u03b3 ). It is perpendicular to n\u03b2. The angle between the optic axes is called the axial angle, or 2V ; in particular, the axial angle is 2 V\u03b1 if it is measured over n\u03b1 and 2V\u03b3 if it is measured over n\u03b3 (Figure 9.19e). On the basis of the geometry of an ellip- soid, the axial angle 2 V\u03b3 = (180\u25e6 \u2212 2V\u03b1) can be calculated from the values of the refractive in- dices along the main axes: tan V\u03b3 = \u221a[( 1/n\u03b1 2 \u22121/n\u03b2 2 )/( 1/n\u03b2 2 \u2212 1/n\u03b3 2 )] (9.5) Like all physical properties the optical indica- trix has to conform to the crystal symmetry, i.e., symmetry elements of the crystal have also to be present in the indicatrix (see Figure 8.7).

The orthorhombic case is shown where indicatrix axes coincide with crystal axes a, b, c. (Cf. also Figure 8.7.) the indicatrix is a sphere, the refractive index is the same in all directions and can be described with a single number, n. Cubic crystals have no direction dependence and are therefore optically isotropic. In cubic crystals all indicatrix sections are circular, and there is no birefringence; if ob- served with crossed polarizers, cubic crystals al- ways appear black. (We have seen in Chapter 8 that isotropy does not necessarily extend to other properties. Indeed elastic properties of cubic crys- tals are not isotropic.) The optical properties of all other crystals are anisotropic. However, there are other symmetry re- strictions. In trigonal, tetragonal, or hexagonal crys- tals with a single 3-, 4- or 6-fold symmetry axis, only a rotational ellipsoid conforms to this sym- metry (Figure 9.21b). In such an ellipsoid two axes are equal in length (either n \u03b1 = n\u03b2 or n\u03b3 = n\u03b2). There is a single circular section perpendicular to the unique ellipsoid axis. This axis is there- fore parallel to the crystallographic z-axis [001]. Because of the unique optic axis, such indicatri- ces are called uniaxial. The unique axis is gen- erally referred to as n \u03b5 (extraordinary direction), and the radius of the circular section is referred to as n /H9275(ordinary direction). Each ellipse section contains the ordinary direction n/H9275as one axis. There are two cases to distinguish: if the unique axis n \u03b5 corresponds to n\u03b3 , i.e., the long axis, the uniaxial indicatrix is called positive (Figure 9.22a, \u2018\u2018cigar shape\u201d); if the unique axis is n\u03b1, i.e., the short axis, it is called negative (Figure 9.22b, \u2018\u2018pan- cake shape\u201d). In Chapter 10 we will learn meth- ods to distinguish between these two cases. Uni- axial crystals can be viewed as special cases of biaxial crystals in which the optic axes coincide (2V = 0 \u25e6). Orthorhombic crystals have a triaxial ellipsoid as an indicatrix and are therefore biaxial, just as we saw in Figure 9.19. However, symmetry constrains the orientation of the indicatrix el- lipsoid in the crystal. The main indicatrix axes, X (n \u03b1), Y (n\u03b2), and Z (n\u03b3 ), which are perpendicu- lar to mirror planes in the indicatrix, have to be parallel to the crystallographic axes x, y, and z, which are perpendicular to mirror planes in the crystal (Figures 9.21c and 8.7c). There is no symmetry constraint to determine which optical direction is parallel to which crystal axis and in the \ufb01gure we have chosen one possibility.

As we will see in Chapter 10, the orientation of the indicatrix of triclinic plagioclase depends on the chemical composition of this mineral with a solid solution, and this orientation can be used for determina- tive purposes. Of course the indicatrix ellipsoid itself always has \u2018\u2018orthorhombic symmetry\u201d, with t h r e em i r r o rp l a n e sa tr i g h ta n g l e s . In the discussion of optically uniaxial crystals, we have de\ufb01ned a positive and negative uniaxial indicatrix, depending on the overall shape of the ellipsoid (Figure 9.22). The same convention can be generalized for biaxial crystals but we cannot simply compare long and short axes n \u03b3 and n\u03b1. In this case we compare the long and short axes with the intermediate axis n \u03b2.I fn \u03b2 is closer to n\u03b1 than it is to n\u03b3 then the ellipsoid is stretched and we call it positive. If n\u03b2 is closer to n\u03b3 than it is to n\u03b1 then the ellipsoid is squashed and we call it negative. This is best de\ufb01ned using the axial angle, which depends on the relationship of the magnitudes of n \u03b1, n\u03b2,a n dn \u03b3 (equation 9.5). We return to Figure 9.19e: if 2 V\u03b3 ,m e a s u r e do v e rZ (n\u03b3 ), is between 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6, then we call the indi- catrix biaxial positive.

In the mineralogical literature, different sym- bols are used to label refractive indices, vibra- tion directions, and indicatrix axis directions. We are using n \u03b1, n\u03b2 and n\u03b3 for the main refractive indices, and X, Y and Z for the corresponding principal indicatrix axis directions. Any arbitrary section of the indicatrix, except for a circular sec- tion, is still an ellipse with two axes, correspond- ing to the two vibration directions. The longer one, with a higher refractive index n \u2032 \u03b3 and slower wave propagation we call the Z \u2032 vibration direc- tion, the shorter one with a lower refractive index n\u2032 \u03b1 and a faster wave propagation we call the X\u2032 vibration direction. Table 9.2 summarizes some of the relationships and conventions to describe optical properties of minerals. Dispersion To achieve total precision in optical analysis would require that one work with monochro- matic light because the refractive index of any light ray varies slightly with wavelength. As we have seen earlier, this change of refractive index with wavelength causes dispersion of white light 500 550 600 Wavelength (nm) 1.56 1.55 1.54 1.53 1.52 1.51 1.50 Refractive index Ethyl salicy late at 10\u00b0C Borosilicate glassEthyl salicylate at 50 \u00b0C FD C 650 E Fig. 9.23 Dispersion curves of borosilicate glass and ethyl salicylate liquid at two temperatures, illustrating the change of refractive index with wavelength. Spectral color lines C, D, E, and F are indicated. They are used in the calculation of the dispersion coef\ufb01cient and the dispersive power. in a prism (see Figure 9.7b). However, for most ap- plications dispersion effects are minor and thus white light is employed. Figure 9.23 shows disper- sion curves for a borosilicate glass and for a liquid (ethyl salicylate), the latter at two temperatures. From this \ufb01gure you can see that the refractive index typically decreases with wavelength, and more so for liquids than for solids. The refrac- tive index also decreases with increasing temper- ature. In biaxial crystals normally all three refractive indices show a similar dispersion behavior and the dispersion curves are parallel (Figure 9.24a). This means that the birefringence (n \u03b3 \u2212 n\u03b1)a n d also the axial angle 2 V remain fairly con- stant. Some minerals, such as sillimanite, display anomalous dispersion, and the dispersion curves for different refractive indices have different slopes (Figure 9.24b). In the case of sillimanite, with a bi- axial positive indicatrix (i.e., n \u03b2 closer to n\u03b1 than to n\u03b3 ), the birefringence ( n\u03b3 \u2212 n\u03b1) decreases with increasing wavelength; also n\u03b2 moves closer to n\u03b3 and therefore 2 V for red (30 \u25e6) is larger than 2 V for violet (21\u25e6), which is marked in determinative tables as ( r > v). In the case of brookite (Figure 9.24c), for short wavelengths n\u03b2 is parallel to [100] and close to n\u03b1, i.e., the crystal is biaxial positive; n\u03b3 is parallel to [010], and", "page": 201}

The axial plane has switched the orientation. We will come back to this example in Chapter 10. To describe dispersion of a material quantita- tively, it is necessary to specify the index of re- fraction at several wavelengths. By convention, indices are usually reported for light of wave- length 486.1 nm (F), 589.3 nm (D), and 656.3 nm Table 9.3 Coefficients of dispersion (nF \u2212 nC) for several materials (Winchell, 1929) Sphalerite 0.08 Diamond 0.062 Sphene 0.02\u20130.04 Epidote 0.012\u20130.025 Zircon 0.022 Garnet 0.015\u20130.021 Calcite 0.013\u20130.014 Olivine 0.013 Feldspars 0.009 Quartz 0.008 (C) corresponding to the Fraunhofer emission lines (Figure 9.23). If nothing is speci\ufb01ed, 589.3 nm (n D) is assumed, which is the light produced by a sodium vapor lamp and is in the middle of the visible spectrum. The coefficient of disper- sion is de\ufb01ned as (n F \u2212 nC)a n dt h edispersive power as (nF \u2212 nC)/(nD \u2212 1). Table 9.3 reports some coef\ufb01- cient of dispersion values for different minerals. Note that diamond has an unusually high disper- sion, causing color spectra when light is refracted on the surfaces of cut gems. Pleochroism As noted above, absorption of light may be dependent on both direction and wavelength. In some crystals all wavelengths of light are absorbed, except for certain directions. This fea- ture is used in the construction of polarizing \ufb01l- ters, for example with an organic material called Polaroid. In many minerals, absorption in certain directions is not complete and occurs for only certain wavelengths. For example, if a thin slice of a crystal of hornblende is rotated on the mi- croscope stage with plane-polarized light (with- out the analyzer), colors change from green to brown (Plate 2i) and the color of glaucophane changes from blue to yellow and colorless (Plate 3a). Minerals of the amphibole group and many types of mica show strong pleochroism. Spectac- ular pleochroism (yellow--pink--red) is observed in the manganese--epidote mineral piedmontite (Table 9.4).

{"text": "Chapter 10 Identi\ufb01cation of minerals with the petrographic microscope\u2217 Sample preparation The use of a polarizing microscope to analyze the optical properties of crystals is a standard tech- nique in mineralogy and petrography. Not only is the petrographic microscope used for identi\ufb01- cation of mineral species, but it can also help to determine structural and chemical variations in minerals -- for example, in solid solutions. Every student of earth sciences should become familiar with this technique and have at least some ex- perience with a petrographic microscope. There are two approaches to such optical studies. One approach is utilized for transparent crystals that are analyzed with transmitted light. The second is used for opaque crystals. In this approach, a modi\ufb01ed polarizing microscope is used and light is reflected from a highly polished surface and then analyzed using similar methods as for trans- mitted light. In the following discussion we will con\ufb01ne ourselves to the \ufb01rst method, which is known as transmitted light microscopy.I no r d e rt o follow the concepts and applications introduced in this chapter, you need to have access to a petrographic microscope and some thin sections. They are available in most geology departments. You can also, as a substitute, consult a recently distributed CD that simulates a microscope (Christiansen, 2001). Most minerals as they occur in rock samples are, at best, translucent. For example, if we put a chip of granite or basalt under the microscope, \u2217 Optional reading. This chapter requires access to a petrographic microscope. no light is transmitted. Thus, in order to trans- mit light, one of two methods must be applied. In the \ufb01rst method, small fragments of \ufb01nely ground crystals are scattered on a glass plate, immersed in oil, and covered by a thin sheet of glass (grain mount) (Figure 10.1a). The second approach is to prepare a petrographic thin section from the rock, ideally of a thickness of 20--30 /H9262m (Figure 10.1b). This is generally done by cut- t i n gas l a b2 c m\u00d7 3c m\u00d7 0.5 cm from the rock sample that contains the region of interest. One side of the slab is polished with a \ufb01ne abrasive (silicon carbide, alumina, or diamond powders) a n dm o u n t e do nag l a s ss l i d ew i t hat r a n s p a r e n t , optically isotropic cement (e.g., baked Canada balsam, called \u2018\u2018Lakeside\u201d, which is soluble in benzene and xylene; \u2018\u2018Crystal bond\u201d, which is sol- uble in acetone; or an insoluble epoxy resin). The other side of the slab is then cut and ground to the desired thickness. The ground side is covered with softer Canada balsam and a thin cover glass. The cover glass ensures normal incidence, and a \ufb02at surface prevents irregular scattering (see Figure 9.5c). By applying this method, most min- erals, except opaque ore minerals such as pyrite and magnetite, become transparent and can be analyzed with the microscope.", "page": 204}

There is a routine procedure that needs to be followed, and should be repeated periodically, es- pecially if other people have used the same mi- croscope (see Figure 9.10c). r For binocular microscopes, there are two ocular lenses in the eyepiece. One ocular lens has a cross-hair and often a scale. Remove that lens, hold it towards a light source (e.g., a window), and focus the cross-hair for your eye. Insert the lens again, and then focus with that lens only on an object on the microscope stage (e.g., a dust particle on a glass slide) by raising or lowering the stage. If you now use your other eye, you will generally \ufb01nd that the object is no longer in focus. Focus it for that eye by adjusting the second ocular lens (without the cross-hair). From now on both eyes should see the object in focus and, in addition, the cross-hair should be in focus. r The center of the stage has to be exactly in the optic axis. Either tilting or translating the objective lens until the object under the cross-hair (e.g., a dust particle) does not move during stage rotation will achieve the needed centering. In general, the object will follow a circle. Move the center of the circle to the cross-hair. This alignment takes several iterations and must be performed separately for each objective lens. r Next the condenser assembly (underneath the stage) needs to be adjusted to have the incoming light reaching the specimen parallel to the axis. To do this, close the condenser aperture until the light beam is observed, and then translate it to the center. r Finally, the polarizer system has to be aligned. Insert the analyzer, without a sample present, and then rotate the polarizer until it is darkest. r Usually the polarizer is oriented east--west (E--W) and the analyzer north--south (N--S), but this con\ufb01guration needs to be veri\ufb01ed. One can make use of a crystal with strong pleochroism and a distinct morphology such as a trigonal crystal of tourmaline, which is often elongated parallel to the c-axis and appears blue if the c-axis is perpendicular to the polarizer direction and yellow if it is parallel to it. One can also take a foil of Polaroid, on which the polarization direction is usually marked. Some general comments about the use of a petrographic microscope: r Adjust the brightness of the light to be comfortable for your eyes. Very bright light causes headaches and burns out \ufb01laments. r Adjust apertures for particular applications. Closing the condenser aperture increases contrast and resolution, particularly at high magni\ufb01cation. r Choose the magni\ufb01cation that is most useful for your investigation.

Determination of the refractive index A petrographic microscope can be used to deter- mine the refractive index of small crystal frag- ments by the immersion method. In this proce- dure, crushed grains, 0.05 to 0.2 mm in size, are mounted on a glass slide, immersed in an oil, and covered by a cover glass to ensure normal incidence (Figure 10.1a). The edges of the crystal fragments act as small prisms. If the refractive index of the crystal is higher than that of the oil, the light is dispersed inwards into the crys- tal (Figure 10.2a), producing a zone of increased brightness inside the contour of the crystal. By fo- c u s i n go nah i g h e rl e v e l ,f r o map l a n e1t o w a r d s a plane 3 (Figure 10.2a), we notice a ring of light, called the Becke line, which moves concentrically into the crystal. If the refractive index of the crys- tal is lower than that of the oil, light is dispersed outwards, and the Becke line moves beyond the crystal into the oil (Figure 10.2b). If the refractive index of the crystal is the same as that of the oil, this line is not observed.

Sets of oils with intervals of 0.01 in refractive indices are avail- able and allow accurate determinations. Because of dispersion, it is sometimes advantageous to make these determinations with monochromatic light, for example by using a \ufb01lter. Oils are far more sensitive to dispersion than most crystals. In these experiments, use high magni\ufb01cation and close the condenser aperture. When crystal and oil are matched, the refractive index of the oil can be determined with a refractometer (either Abbe (Figure 9.6b) or Leitz--Jelley refractometers are usually available in mineralogy laboratories). The refractive index is a diagnostic tool and is used as an identi\ufb01cation", "page": 206}

If X and Z are parallel to either the po- larizer or analyzer, we observe extinction (see Figure 9.15f). At 45 \u25e6 from the extinction position (see Figure 9.15e), a maximum amount of light is transmitted, and this light is used to evaluate in- terference colors. Thus, in general, it is necessary t or o t a t et h ec r y s t a lo nt h es t a g et ob r i n gi ti n t o a position where a maximum of light is trans- mitted. By comparing the color of the mineral with the color chart (Plate 1a), we can determine the retardation and, if the thickness is known (25--30 /H9262m for a standard thin section), the value of the birefringence (n\u2032 \u03b3 \u2212 n\u2032 \u03b1 ). However, what one really needs to know is the maximum (true) bire- fringence (n\u03b3 \u2212 n\u03b1), i.e., the difference between the largest and smallest refractive index. The true birefringence is a diagnostic material property for a mineral and can be used for its identi\ufb01- cation, but most crystals in thin section do not display it. In a thin section of a rock, most crystals are in arbitrary orientations and each grain will show different interference colors, corresponding to a different birefringence (n \u2032 \u03b3 \u2212 n\u2032 \u03b1 ), rather than the maximum birefringence ( n\u03b3 \u2212 n\u03b1). For example, if the section of a biaxial crystal is close to a circular section of the indicatrix, we will observe low-order colors, even though the mineral may have a high birefringence (n \u03b3 \u2212 n\u03b1). Among all crystals of the same mineral in a thin section, we determine (n \u03b3 \u2212 n\u03b1)b ym a t c h i n gt h ehighest- order colors with the interference color chart. This is straightforward if a thin section contains only one mineral species (e.g., quartz in a quartzite, or calcite in a marble), but requires some practice if different mineral species are present (such as pyroxene and olivine in a basalt). This maximum birefringence can then be used for determinative purposes (e.g., see Appendix 4). As an exercise we could use interference col- ors to determine the thickness of", "page": 207}

(c, d) The crystal is rotated 45\u25e6. In this orientation the brightest interference colors are observed with crossed polarizers \u2013 for example, \ufb01rst-order blue (e, f; Cr for crystal). In this diagonal position a compensator crystal (Co) is superposed. In the case of (c), long ellipse axes (vibration directions) of crystal and compensator are parallel and cause addition (e; Co for compensator, Cr + Co for compensator plus crystal), producing second-order green. In (d) long ellipse axes of crystal and compensator are at right angles and cause subtraction (f), resulting in white/yellow interference colors. Petrographic microscopes are equipped with accessory compensator crystals, for which interfer- ence colors and orientation are known. By com- paring the known optical orientation of the com- pensator with the unknown optical orientation of the crystal we can determine the latter. We will introduce and explain the procedure for a hexagonal prismatic crystal with the c-axis [0001] in the plane of the stage (similar to the quartz crystal illustrated in Plate 1d). The pris- matic elongation direction corresponds to the extraordinary indicatrix direction n \u03b5, the ellip- soidal indicatrix section is indicated. If n\u03b5 is n\u03b3 (slow direction), then the crystal is uniaxial posi- tive (Figure 10.4a); if n \u03b5 = n\u03b1 (fast direction), then it is uniaxial negative (Figure 10.4b). First we ro- tate a prismatic crystal on the microscope stage, using crossed polarizers, until it is extinct, which is the case when the c-axis is either parallel or perpendicular to the polarizer (Figure 10.4a,b). Next we rotate the stage 45 \u25e6 to bring the c-axis into the NE--SW sectors (Figure 10.4c,d) and bright colors will be observed. The next step is to superpose the compen- sator crystal. Compensators are inserted at a 45 \u25e6 angle into the light path (NW--SE). The most commonly used compensator (also known as", "page": 208}

A more sophisticated compensator is a quartz wedge with variable thickness, as shown in Figure 9.16.) Superpos- ing the compensator on our unknown crystal, we can determine n \u2032 \u03b1 and n\u2032 \u03b3 in the crystal, depend- ing on whether the path difference of \ufb01rst-order red from the compensator is added to or sub- tracted from the interference colors of the crystal (Figure 10.4e,f). In the case of Figure 10.4c vibra- tion ellipses of the compensator and the crys- tal have the same orientation. Retardations are therefore added and we observe higher-order col- ors (addition) (Figure 10.4e). In this case n \u03b3 is parallel to the c-axis and we have veri\ufb01ed that the crystal is uniaxial positive. In the case of Figure 10.4d, vibration ellipses of compensator and crystal are in opposite orientations. The re- tardation produced in the crystal is reversed as light goes through the compensator, resulting in lower-order colors (subtraction) (Figure 10.4f).

Internal markers are cleavage traces, twin planes, or exsolution lamellae. They appear as hairline fractures. In order to have the crystal in some reference orientation, one usu- ally chooses a crystal orientation in which either two cleavage systems or a twin and a cleavage are viewed edge on. For example, aragonite has a good (010) cleavage (Figure 10.5a). If we observe the crystal along either the a-o rt h ec -axis, this cleavage system is viewed edge on.

In this case the (001) cleavage is viewed edge-on and appears as a single, sharp line, when viewed with the microscope. The {210} cleavages are in- clined to the section and the cleavage plane, over the thickness of the section, appears as diffuse bands. On focusing, for example, from M to N, the line does shift. Such oblique cleavages are usually avoided as a reference system. From Fig- ure 10.5a and the ellipsoid in Figure 10.6a we see that Z (n \u03b3 ) is parallel to the (001) cleavage trace and perpendicular to both {210} cleavage traces, and therefore we observe extinction if a cleavage trace is parallel or perpendicular to the polarizer (E--W). This is referred to as parallel extinction and is common in orthorhombic minerals. Next we look at a monoclinic amphibole crys- tal, such as hornblende, which has an excellent {110} cleavage (Figure 10.5c). If we observe the crystal in a thin section cut perpendicular to [001], cleavages (110) and (1 \u00af10) are both edge- on, and at a characteristic 124 \u25e6 angle (Figure 10.6b).

Observation of interference figures with convergent light In the previous section we described how to de- termine the optical properties of a crystal from a thin section, using light in a single direction, i.e., the microscope axis. But the crystal and its optical properties (represented by the indicatrix) are three-dimensional. In order to determine the full shape and orientation of the indicatrix, we must either tilt the crystal on the stage or use light at an inclined angle. The former operation can be done with a Universal stage, mounted onto the microscope stage. We will not discuss this rather specialized yet powerful method here but refer the interested reader to the litera- ture (Reinhard, 1931; Slemmons, 1962; Phillips, 1971). The second method is more widely applied. Using convergent,i n s t e a do fparallel, light allows us to analyze the indicatrix in different directions. By inserting a special condenser lens underneath the specimen, one can produce a range of light that enters the sample at angles between 90 \u25e6 and Interference figure (focal plane) Objective lens Crystal Condenser lens Fig. 10.7 Ray path for image formation with convergent light. The condenser lens produces incident light at different directions and the objective lens forms an interference \ufb01gure in the focal plane. 50\u25e6 (Figure 10.7). The light is then imaged with a high-magni\ufb01cation lens close to the crystal. With this geometry the objective lens does not form an image of the object, as with parallel illumi- nation, but of the light source. Rays entering the crystal at different angles are focused at differ- ent places in the focal plane. This so-called inter- ference figure does not resolve details about the object, but rather displays interference effects at different angles. The central part of the \ufb01gure corresponds to rays parallel to the microscope axis and the periphery corresponds to highly in- clined rays (Figure 10.8a). The interference \ufb01gure is real and can be observed without an ocular lens (simply remove it). However, generally an ad- ditional lens, the Bertrand lens, which is part of a petrographic microscope, is inserted (see Figure 9.10b and c). Uniaxial interference figures We will \ufb01rst discuss interference \ufb01gures for uni- axial crystals with the optic axis aligned with the microscope axis (Figure 10.8). The interference \ufb01g- ure can be viewed as a sort of spherical projection of the indicatrix, displaying optical properties in each direction. If the ellipse axes, viewed at a certain angle, are parallel to the polarizer or an- alyzer, extinction occurs; if they are not, interfer- ence colors appear corresponding to d(n \u2032 \u03b3 \u2212 n\u2032 \u03b1 ). Figure 10.8a shows simpli\ufb01ed ray paths through the condenser lens and the indicatrix (1--4), and the projected views of the ellipses on a hemi- sphere for a uniaxial positive crystal.

When the crystal is rotated on the stage, different ellipses come into the N--S and E--W directions (Figure 10.8b,c) but the pattern remains the same (Figure 10.8d, Plate 1e,g). This is due to the axial symmetry of the indicatrix. In the sectors that are not extinct, there are concentric circles of equal interference color (isochromes).

When a compensator plate is added, those points of the interference \ufb01gure for which n\u2032 \u03b3 in the crystal is parallel to n\u2032 \u03b3 (Z \u2032) of the compen- sator (slow) will add; those for which n\u2032 \u03b1 in the crystal is parallel to n\u2032 \u03b3 of the compensator will subtract. If the crystal is uniaxial positive, there is addition in the NE--SW quadrants and sub- traction in the NW--SE quadrants (Figure 10.8e, Plate 1f for quartz). The opposite is true for a uniaxial negative crystal (Figure 10.8f, Plate 1h for calcite). This method enables us to determine the optic sign very quickly. (Adding the compen- sators to the isogyres produces the colors of the compensator, in the case of Plate 1f,h \ufb01rst-order red.) Crystals in a good orientation for centered in- terference \ufb01gures are relatively easy to \ufb01nd in a thin section by searching for those with low retardation. If the optic axis is inclined, inter- ference \ufb01gures are less symmetrical and the in- terpretation is more dif\ufb01cult and requires some practice (Figure 10.9). The melatope is no longer in the cross-hair and rotates as the crystal is ro- tated on the stage. Also, isochromes are no longer ideal circles because thickness and birefringence M M Fig. 10.9 Isogyres in an off-center uniaxial interference \ufb01gure in two stage rotations.

Uniaxial interfer- ence \ufb01gures all have the property in common that the isogyres remain more or less parallel during stage rotation and can usually be inter- preted, even if the melatope is not within the \ufb01eld of view. The situation is different for inter- ference \ufb01gures of biaxial crystals. Biaxial interference figures The same logic used to interpret uniaxial inter- ference \ufb01gures can also be used to interpret those from biaxial crystals. In Figure 10.10a we look from various directions at a biaxial positive indicatrix, which is oriented with the acute bisectrix Z (n \u03b3 ) along the microscope axis (ray 1). As can be seen, the circular section (ray 3) is not in the center of the hemispherical projection. Ellipses 1 and 2 have the long axis in the N--S direction, ellipses 4 and 5 in the E--W direction. Figure 10.10b shows all the corresponding indicatrix sections for a biaxial positive crystal, and Figure 10.10c for a biaxial negative crystal. In both cases we recog-", "page": 214}

But contrary to the case of uniaxial crystals the pattern does not show axial symmetry. Since ellipse axes along the N--S and E--W diameters are parallel to the polarizer and analyzer, we again observe a black cross, but contrary to the uniaxial case the vertical and hor- izontal isogyres are not equivalent and have dif- ferent thicknesses. Figure 10.10d is an interfer- ence \ufb01gure corresponding to Figure 10.10b and c (see also Plate 2a). Note, also, that the isochromes are much more complicated than in the uniax- ial case, since changes in thickness and birefrin- gence do not go in parallel, i.e., the effective sam- ple thickness increases uniformly from ray 1 to 5, i.e., from the center to the periphery, but bire- fringence does not. The birefringence increases with distance from the melatope. Since the pattern in Figure 10.10b,c is not axi- ally symmetrical, interference conditions change as we rotate the crystal. If we perform a 45 \u25e6 clock- wise rotation we obtain Figure 10.10e,f. Again we construct isogyres by \ufb01nding ellipse axes (vi- bration directions) that are parallel or perpen- dicular to the analyzer (A) (shaded in Figure 10.10e,f).

{"text": "OBSERVATION OF INTERFERENCE FIGURES WITH CONVERGENT LIGHT 193 In this oriented biaxial interference \ufb01gure (Figure 10.10d,g and Plate 2a,b), with the acute bisectrix (Bxa) (cf. Figure 9.19e) parallel to the mi- croscope axis, we wish to determine whether the mineral is biaxial positive (Figure 10.10b,c) or bi- axial negative (Figure 10.10e,f). This can be done, as in the case of uniaxial minerals, by using com- pensators. We need to determine whether the direction normal to the axial plane (optic nor- mal) is n \u03b1 or n\u03b3 . We observe \ufb01rst the black cross (Figure 10.10d), and then open the isogyres by rotating the stage, keeping track of the rotation of the melatopes (Figure 10.10g). At 45 \u25e6 we in- sert the compensator crystal and check in which quadrant addition or subtraction of interference colors occurs (Figure 10.10h,i and Plate 2c). The interpretation is similar to the uniaxial case (see Figure 10.8e,f). In the case of a positive biaxial indicatrix, there is addition in the NE and SW sectors (where large ellipse axes of crystal and compensator line up), whereas for a negative bi- axial indicatrix, there is subtraction. Melatopes indicate the position of the optic axes. The line connecting the two melatopes de\ufb01nes the axial plane, the distance between the two melatopes is indicative of the axial angle 2V . If 2 V is small, melatopes are close together and close to the Bxa. If 2 V is near 65 \u25e6 (in the case of muscovite, 2 V is around 40 \u25e6, Plate 2b), mela- topes are near the periphery, and for larger an- gles they are outside the \ufb01eld of view. Such obser- vations can be used to estimate the axial angle. Centered Bxa interference \ufb01gures of biaxial crystals such as those shown in Figure 10.10 and Plate 2a--c are easy to interpret, at least if the axial angle is not too large. However, it is often dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd crystals in that orientation. They correspond neither to crystals with a very low re- tardation (such as circular sections in the uniax- ial case), nor to crystals with a very high retarda- tion, but rather are of intermediate retardation. However, also for biaxial crystals the circular section is easy to \ufb01nd because of the low retar- dation (and interference color), and it can also be interpreted. If we view a crystal along one of the optic axes (one melatope), isogyres are not very symmetrical, but at least one branch of the isogyres always passes through the center of the \ufb01gure and one melatope is in the center.

For intermediate an- gles 2 V can be estimated, using the calibration on Figure 10.11. In this orientation the second branch of isogyres is visible only for low axial angles (i.e., 15 \u25e6 in Figure 10.11). The position of the axial plane is obvious, and the optic sign of the crystal is therefore quickly determined with a compensator. This is the preferred section for routine analysis of biaxial crystals. Dispersion Dispersion is expressed in interference \ufb01gures, since the orientation and shape of the indica- trix depends to some extent on wavelength (see p. 177). This is particularly the case for anoma- lous dispersion, where the birefringence changes with direction. A good example is the monoclinic K-feldspar sanidine. In high-temperature sanidine the axial plane is (010), i.e., the mirror plane of this monoclinic mineral, and mirror symmetry has to apply to all colors. Indeed the interference \ufb01gure (Plate 2d) shows mirror symmetry, but the i s o g y r e ss h o wab l u ef r i n g eo nt h ei n s i d ea n dr e d", "page": 216}
{"text": "194 IDENTIFICATION WITH THE PETROGRAPHIC MICROSCOPE fringe on the outside. Therefore 2 V is larger for violet than for red, which is abbreviated (e.g., in Table 19.2) as r < v. Because of the mirror sym- metry, this is called inclined dispersion. In low- temperature sanidine the axial plane is perpen- dicular to (010) and the axial plane pivots on [010]. In this case the mirror symmetry no longer ap- plies to colors, but the 2-fold rotation does. This produces color fringes related by a rotation about the acute bisectrix (Plate 2e). In Figure 9.24c and the discussion in Chap- ter 9, we looked at the anomalous dispersion of orthorhombic brookite, where the axial plane for red light is (100), for green light it appears uniax- ial and for blue light it is (001). This is best seen in interference \ufb01gures with monochromatic light (Plate 2f--h). Optical activity Finally a few words should be said about optical activity. If polarized light passes through a crys- tal that lacks a center of symmetry, the plane of polarization is rotated to either the left or the right, depending upon whether the crystal is left or right handed. The amount of rotation depends on thickness and wavelength. For quartz it is 22.1 \u25e6/mm when viewed along the c-axis with yellow light (589 nm). For a 30 /H9262m thin section this is meaningless, but for a thicker slab viewed with crossed polarizers the mineral is not ex- tinct, as one would expect for a uniaxial crys- tal. This rotation leads to interference \ufb01gures in which the isogyres do not extend to the center and are replaced by a bright circular region (Fig- ure 10.12a). In monochromatic light this bright region can be brought to extinction when the analyzer is rotated from the crossed position. These abnormal interference \ufb01gures can be used to con\ufb01rm the hand of rotation. Monochromatic interference \ufb01gures with a \u03bb/4 compensator su- perposed show a spiral (so-called Airy\u2019s spiral, Figure 10.12b). The sense of the spiral is the same as that of the crystal (left handed). Optical activ- ity is particularly pronounced in organic crystals such as sucrose. Most biologically grown organic crystals are left handed, while synthetic crystals vary in handedness. The procedure for analyzing (a) (b) Fig. 10.12 Interference \ufb01gures illustrating optical activity of quartz. (a) Quartz slab of 4 mm thickness viewed along the c-axis.

{"text": "CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPORTANT ROCK-FORMING MINERALS 195 Box 10.2 Determination of the optical character by means of interference figures 1. Find a crystal in the thin section with an optic axis parallel to the microscope axis. Such a crystal is easily selected because those orientations have no retardation and, with crossed polarizers, stay extinct during rotation of the stage. After identifying a crystal, go to high magni\ufb01cation. Make sure that the objective lens is centered and that the area of interest does not move during stage rotation. 2. Obtain an interference \ufb01gure by inserting the condenser lens, which must be close to the thin section. Also insert the Bertrand lens (or remove the ocular lens). 3. Uniaxial crystals: The interference \ufb01gure of a uniaxial crystal has axially symmet- rical isochromes. Their color pattern corresponds to the birefringence and can be compared with the color chart. With a thin section of standard thickness, for quartz the highest-order color is yellow; for calcite, with a high birefringence, isochromes show many orders of color. The cross of isogyres is oriented N\u2013S and E\u2013W and does not change during rotation of the stage. The optical char- acter (+ or \u2212) can be determined by inserting compensator plates at any rotation of the stage. If the optic axis is inclined to the microscope axis, the melatope (and the cross) are not centered and move during stage rotation. However, the isogyre branches stay as straight lines and displace in a parallel fashion; such patterns can therefore be interpreted. 4. Biaxial crystals (a) In biaxial crystals isochromes are not circular, but instead display more complicated curves, centered around the optic axes. Isogyres are curved and change their curvature during rotation. In optic axis \ufb01gures, they divide the \ufb01eld into three, but only two of those \ufb01elds are generally visible. If there is subtraction in the SE sector with an acute angle of the isogyre arc, the crystal is biaxial positive. (b) It is usually possible to distinguish between uniaxial and biaxial crystals, even in inclined sections (in biaxial crystals isogyres change their curvature during stage rotation), but it may be very dif\ufb01cult to determine the optical character unless the section is nearly normal to an optic axis or Bxa. Interference \ufb01gures with the Bxo orn \u03b2 close to the microscope axis show broad isogyres that change rapidly with stage rotation. They are ambiguous and are best avoided. (c) In biaxial minerals, we can determine, or at least estimate, the optical angle 2V . This can be done in a section normal to an optic axis using the curvature of the hyperbola. Alternatively, we can measure the distance between the axes in a section normal to the Bxa. With a high magni\ufb01cation objective lens (e.g., numerical aperture 0.85, as marked on the lens), the total \ufb01eld of view is 63 \u25e6. For larger 2 V, it can be estimated from the speed with which the hyperbolas move outward during a rotation of the stage. (High precision determination of axial", "page": 218}

Distinguishing quartz from feldspar Feldspar and quartz are the commonest crustal minerals and occur together in rocks of many different kinds. Even though both have a simi- lar birefringence (gray to white in standard thin sections), optical identi\ufb01cation of the two min- erals is relatively simple. The most important distinguishing features (in order of importance) are the following: r Undulatory extinction: Quartz commonly shows irregular or patchy extinction, dividing each grain into domains (Plate 3b). This effect is not seen in feldspar. r Twinning: Quartz is rarely twinned in an optically obvious fashion, whereas feldspars are most commonly twinned on a variety of twin laws. Particularly in plagioclase, grains are divided into lamellar stripes with different extinction (Plate 3b). r Cleavage: Quartz lacks cleavage. Feldspars have two good cleavages -- (001) and (010) -- more or less at 90 \u25e6. Cleavage may be dif\ufb01cult to", "page": 219}

Relative to balsam, all alkali feldspars have negative relief. Most plagioclase feldspars have positive relief, increasing with anorthite (Ca) content (Figure 10.13). Quartz (n \u03b5 = 1.553, n\u03c9 = 1.544) always shows slight positive relief against balsam. r Optical symmetry and sign: Quartz is uniaxial positive. Feldspars, being monoclinic or triclinic, are biaxial. K-feldspars are optically negative, with either large 2 V (orthoclase and microcline) or small 2 V (sanidine) angles. Plagioclases have large 2 V angles, and the optic sign depends on composition. r Alteration: Quartz does not alter to other minerals and is typically clear and colorless in thin section. Feldspar is subject to alteration and is commonly cloudy or \u2018\u2018dirty-looking\u201d in comparison with adjacent quartz. Such alteration is often to sericite mica and is usually concentrated in patches or along cleavages. When alteration-free, feldspars are generally glass clear, like quartz. Alkali feldspars The alkali feldspars form a solid solution se- ries between albite (NaAlSi 3O8) and ortho- clase (KAlSi 3O8) that is complete only at high temperature. In plutonic rocks (those cooled slowly within the earth), feldspars intermedi- ate in this series exsolve into two-phase crystals called perthites.I nm a n yo ft h e s er o c k s ,t h ei n - dividual exsolved parts can be seen through the microscope as wavy lamellar features (Plate 3c). Twinning (see Chapter 5) in monoclinic alkali feldspars (such as orthoclase and sanidine) is con\ufb01ned to simple doublets (a common law is Carlsbad, with twin axis [001] and composition plane (010)). The triclinic feldspars (microcline) commonly show lamellar twinning on the Albite law (twin axis perpendicular to (010), composi- tion plane (010)) and the Pericline law (twin axis [010], composition plane ( h0l)). (Note that Albite and Pericline are capitalized if the names refer to twin laws, rather than to the mineral.)

Low albite is optically positive, with very high 2 V \u03b3 (80\u25e6). r High albite (volcanic) is similar to low albite but optically negative with moderate 2 V \u03b1 (about 45\u25e6). r Sanidine from volcanic rocks (\u2018\u2018 high sanidine\u201d) may display simple doublet twinning and is usually clear and glassy. The optical axial plane is at a right angle to the twin composition plane (contrary to orthoclase) and perpendicular to [010] = Y (Figure 10.14b, Plate 2d). Sanidine is optically negative with a small 2V \u03b1 (about 18\u25e6). It can be confused with quartz, but quartz is uniaxial positive. r Microcline has characteristic cross-hatched twinning and is optically negative, with large 2V \u03b1. The axial plane is similar to orthoclase (Figure 10.14c) but orthoclase does not display cross-hatched twinning. Plagioclase feldspars The plagioclase feldspars form a solid solution series between albite (NaAlSi 3O8) and anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8). The Ca:(Ca + Na) ratio, commonly referred to as anorthite content or An-content,i s an important diagnostic feature in determin- ing the rock type or the metamorphic grade. Therefore optical properties are often used as a rapid method of estimating the composition. Op- tically, two main types of plagioclase feldspar are distinguished: high-temperature, disordered pla- gioclases are typical of phenocrysts in extrusive volcanic rocks, and low-temperature, ordered pla- gioclases are typical of slowly cooled feldspars in plutonic and metamorphic rocks. In triclinic plagioclase there are no symmetry constraints on the orientation of the optical indicatrix. In- deed, as Figure 10.15 illustrates, the optical di- rections, including the axial plane (AP) rotate greatly between albite and anorthite, while the crystallographic axes barely change. Better than the sketches in Figure 10.15, the stereographic projection in Figure 10.16 documents the large rotations of indicatrix axes X, Y and Z , and op- tical axes A and B , relative to the crystal struc- ture, between albite (Ab) and anorthite (An). As a reference coordinate system the c-axis [001] of this triclinic mineral is placed in the cen- ter and the pole to (010) in the E-point. Some other lattice planes, corresponding to twin laws are indicated. There are two curves: the dashed lines are for plutonic and metamorphic plagio- clase, with an ordered structure, and the dotted lines for volcanic plagioclases with a disordered structure.

They do not sway sideways, as focus is slightly raised and then lowered. When (010) is parallel to the N--S vibration direction of the analyzer, the twin lamellae are uniformly illuminated (Figure 10.17a). (Similar looking Pericline twins do not show this feature and cannot be used for this method.) When the thin section is rotated clockwise by an angle \u0394, one set of twins becomes extinct (the other set becomes extinct if the section is rotated by the same angle counterclockwise). Extinction angles are measured between n \u2032 \u03b1 and the trace of (010) for Albite twins. It is necessary to identify whether the extinct N--S direction is n\u2032 \u03b1 and not n\u2032 \u03b3 . This can be done by rotating the extinct direction 45 \u25e6 clockwise (it will show interference colors) and inserting the compensator. If you observe subtraction, it is n \u2032 \u03b1. Figure 10.17b explains how to identify a positive extinction angle (n \u2032 \u03b1 in the acute angle between (001) and (010) traces, as is the case for calcic plagioclase). Figure 10.17c illustrates the case for a negative angle (n \u2032 \u03b1 in the obtuse angle between cleavages, as is the case for sodic plagioclase). The extinction", "page": 222}

Shown is the rotation of the optical indicatrix (vibration directions X, Y , Z) and the optical axes (A and B )a sa function of plagioclase composition from albite (Ab) to anorthite (An). Dashed curves are for plutonic and metamorphic plagioclase (ordered structure) and dotted curves for volcanic plagioclase (disordered structure). Note that some optical directions change their orientation by over 90 \u25e6. Such measurements are best accomplished with a petrographic microscope, equipped with a universal stage. Some crystallographic directions relevant to plagioclase twin laws are indicated as reference (after Burri et al., 1967). angle varies by more than 60 \u25e6 between albite and anorthite (Figure 10.18) and the determinative curves are different for volcanic and plutonic plagioclase. The extinction angle is a quick method for determining the composition of plagioclase. Plagioclase in igneous rocks often displays compositional zoning that re\ufb02ects the cooling history. This is expressed in variable extinction, often concentric, in phenocrysts (Plate 3e). r Extinction angles on cleavage fragments (grain mounts): Plagioclases have (010) and (001) cleavages at almost 90 \u25e6. In this method, cleavage \ufb02akes of crushed plagioclase are mounted in suitable immersion oil. Fragments lying on the (001) cleavage, which is usually better developed and will show uniform birefringence, and the composition planes of Albite twins will be parallel to the trace of the second cleavage (010). The extinction angle of the fast n \u2032 \u03b1 direction with respect to this trace is measured and compared with the determinative curve (Figure 10.18). Fragments lying on the (010) cleavage are recognized by the lack of lamellar Albite twinning. They are not suitable for this method. r Axial angles. Determination of the axial angle 2V\u03b3 (Figure 10.19) is less diagnostic than the extinction angle because of the sinusoidal variation with An content and the large difference between volcanic and plutonic varieties for sodium-rich plagioclase. For example a 2 V of 90 \u25e6 could be interpreted as a plutonic oligoclase (An 18), andesine (An 32) or bytownite (An 71), or as a volcanic andesine (An 38) or bytownite (An 75).

Olivine is the main component of the upper mantle of the earth. All olivines are biaxial with a large axial angle. Olivine is orthorhombic and the axial plane is (001) (Figure 10.20a).

In orthopyroxenes all prismatic sections (with c = [001] in the plane of the section) have par- allel extinction since Z = [001] (Figure 10.21a--b). In clinopyroxenes extinction is parallel in (100) sections and inclined in (010) sections (Figure 10.21c--e). The extinction angle between Z (n \u03b3 ) and [001] is used for determinative purposes. The ranges for extinction angles in clinopyroxenes in sections cut parallel to (010) are shown in Figure 10.22a. In this most useful section, cleavages are inclined about 45 \u25e6 to the section, in two direc- tions, which can be ascertained by focusing, and (100) twins are viewed edge-on (see below). The common amphiboles contain calcium (tremolite--actinolite series) and some are, in ad- dition, aluminous (hornblendes). Alkali-bearing varieties occur in both metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks. With the exception of some of the alkali varieties (e.g., riebeckite in which the axial plane is perpendicular to (010)), amphiboles have (010) as the axial plane (see Figure 10.21f). On section (010), the extinction angle between Z and c = [001] (cleavage trace) ranges, in all but alkali amphiboles, between 0 \u25e6 and 30\u25e6 (Figure 10.22b). Most amphiboles, except tremolite and an- thophyllite, show distinct pleochroism (see Table 9.4). Green colors are typical for calcic amphiboles (Plate 2i) and blue colors for sodic amphiboles (Plate 3a). The colors become stronger with increasing iron content. Micas Micas, as well as the related chlorites, are easy to identify in thin sections through the following obvious optical properties: r Cleavage: Excellent (001) cleavage is observed in all sheet silicates. r Pleochroism: All iron-bearing sheet silicates, including micas as well as chlorites, have distinct pleochroism, with colors ranging between green and brown. r Indicatrix orientation relative to cleavage: All micas are optically negative, and the acute bisectrix X (n \u03b1)i sn e a r l yn o r m a lt ot h eb a s a l cleavage (001) (Figure 10.23). In other words, \ufb02akes of mica on a microscope slide produce essentially centered Bxa interference \ufb01gures and this is a good material on which to practice observing interference \ufb01gures (Plate 2a--c).

Maximum birefringence is seen in sections cut at right angles to the cleavage, and these produce interference colors up to third order in standard thin sections (e.g., Plate 4c). Basal sections (sections cut parallel to the cleavage plane) have low birefringence and produce Bxa interference \ufb01gures with relatively small 2 V \u03b1. Chlorites are distinguished from biotites by much lower birefringence and abnormal interference colors due to anomalous dispersion. r Appearance at extinction: In thin section, micas cut across the cleavage and showing high birefringence have a mottled or twinkling appearance at and very near the extinction position. This is a distinctive characteristic of mica in thin section. Calcite and dolomite Calcite and dolomite, as well as the much rarer orthorhombic aragonite, are, like all carbonate minerals, recognized by a very high birefringence (0.15--0.2) (Plate 1g,h, Plate 5b). Aragonite is biaxial, 2 V \u03b1 = 18\u25e6. Rhombohedral carbonates -- among them, calcite and dolomite -- are uniax- ial negative and would be dif\ufb01cult to distinguish were it not for the characteristic twinning that is present in most crystals from carbonate-bearing rocks. The most common twinning, {01\u00af18}=e in calcite (Figure 10.24a,c) is at a shallow angle to the basal plane, and {01\u00af12}= f in dolomite (Figure 10.24b,d) at a much larger angle to the basal plane. These twins are generally mechan- ically induced. The angles between twin traces, cleavage traces, and in particular the angles be- tween the c-axis and a twin trace, are best seen in stereographic projections (Figure 10.24c,d) and are used to distinguish between the two carbon- ate minerals (Table 10.1). Some common orthosilicate minerals In conclusion of this survey of optical properties of rock-forming minerals, a few words should be said about epidote, and the three polymorphic minerals sillimanite, andalusite, and kyanite. All are fairly common in metamorphic rocks and will be discussed extensively in Chapter 26. Monoclinic epidote (Figure 10.25a) resem- bles olivine but generally displays cleavage. It shows characteristically brilliant interference colors (particularly the variety allanite) that do not \ufb01t the color chart and are due to abnormal dispersion (Plate 5a). Contrary to olivine, epidote shows weak pleochroism. Sillimanite, andalusite, and kyanite, all of composition Al 2SiO5, occur in schistose meta- morphic rocks and show similarities in thin sections (Plate 4d). Sillimanite and andalusite are orthorhombic and have parallel extinction. Sillimanite is often \ufb01brous and has a perfect (010) cleavage (Plate 4c). It is biaxial positive, w i t has m a l l2V \u03b3 (20\u25e6--30\u25e6).

{"text": "Chapter 11 Color Introduction In Chapters 9 and 10 we used the interaction of light with crystals to characterize minerals with a transmitted light petrographic microscope. We noted that properties such as refractive index and birefringence are intrinsic properties of crystals and can be used for identi\ufb01cation purposes. We also introduced the concept of color when de- scribing properties such as pleochroism or in- terference colors, but we have not really dealt with the apparent color of macroscopic minerals. The color of a mineral is our perception of the wavelengths of light that are either re\ufb02ected or transmitted through the material and that reach our eye. Color is one of the most striking fea- tures of minerals and is most readily observed. There are many reasons why a mineral displays a particular apparent color, all related to the in- teraction of light with the crystal. Light may be transmitted, absorbed, scattered, refracted, or re- \ufb02 e c t e db yac r y s t a l .A sw ew i l ls e e ,h o w e v e r ,c o l o r is generally not a bulk property determined by the general structure, as for example is the re- fractive index, but rather depends on the trace elements present, or on mineral defects. For ex- ample, a mineral with the general composition Al 2O3 may be white (as corundum), red (as ruby, Plate 13b), or blue (as sapphire, Plate 13c,d), with only very minor differences in composition. The same is true for quartz, basically SiO 2, which can be colorless-transparent, purple (as amethyst), yellow (as citrine), pink (as rose quartz), brown (as smoky quartz), black (as morion), or green (as chrysoprase). We will \ufb01rst investigate light absorption. A summary of the causes of color in minerals is given in Table 11.1. Absorption If white light is transmitted through a crys- tal without absorption, the crystal appears clear and colorless. If some wavelengths are preferen- tially absorbed, the combination of the remain- ing spectrum is perceived as color. For example, in the corundum variety ruby, the colors vio- let, green, and yellow are preferentially absorbed, leaving a spectrum composed largely of blue and red that gives rise to the typical dark-red ruby color. We have already discussed the interaction of electromagnetic radiation and atoms in Chapter 7. When highly energized electrons hit a metal target, they displace inner electrons (e.g., from the K- to the L-shell), and when an electron returns to the ground state, the gained energy is emitted as X-rays. These inner electron transitions require high energies and are associ- ated with very short wavelengths, but basically similar transitions occur at much longer wave- lengths. Transitions in the energy levels of outer electrons can be in the visible range. For exam- ple, the energy of a light photon may be absorbed and used to displace an electron to a higher energy level, leaving a lower energy level vacancy (Figure 11.1a).

Absorption in the visible range is controlled largely by electron transitions between different energy levels, such as crystal \ufb01eld transitions, molecular orbital transitions, and transitions caused by defects called color centers. These transitions are discussed in turn in the remainder of this section. In the infrared range, molecular vibrations of water (H 2O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) generally cause absorption. At yet longer wavelengths, absorption is caused by lattice vibrations. We will discuss some of these effects in more detail in Chapter 12 but introduce here some concepts that are pertinent to color in minerals.

Crystal field transitions are electronic transi- tions between partially \ufb01lled 3d -orbitals of tran- sition elements (titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper) or par- tially \ufb01lled 4d -orbitals in lanthanides and ac- tinides. These elements are particularly active in color development because the outer orbitals of these elements contain unpaired electrons.

Since the presence of these elements causes color, they are known as chromophore elements. Let us look at an iron atom with six d-electrons distributed over \ufb01ve orbitals. Three d-orbitals ( d xy , dyz ,a n dd xz )h a v et h es h a p eo f butter\ufb02ies and are diagonal between two axes (Figure 11.3a). Two d-orbitals ( d x2\u2212y2 and dz2 )a r e aligned with the axes (Figure 11.3b). In an isolated atom, the energy levels of all states are identi- cal. In a crystal structure, iron is surrounded by anions and they induce an electrical \ufb01eld about the cation; this is known as a \u2018\u2018crystal \ufb01eld\u2019\u2019. In the case of a transition metal ion with partially \ufb01lled orbitals there is a nonuniform interaction between d-orbitals and neighboring anions. Take, for example, Fe in octahedral coordination and surrounded by six oxygen atoms (Figure 11.4a). Oxygen atoms surrounding the iron ion cause electrons in diagonal orbitals (d xy , dyz ,a n dd xz ), referred to as t 2g orbitals, to have a lower en- ergy because they are further apart from the O \u2212. Electrons in orbitals aligned with the axes ( dx2\u2212y2 and dz2 ), referred to as e g orbitals, have a higher energy because they are closer to oxygen and neg- atively charged oxygen ions repel the electrons. The crystal \ufb01eld of an octahedral atom with d-electrons splits into two different energy levels in the case of undistorted octahedra (Figure 11.4b). The energy difference /Delta1E between the levels corresponds to wavelengths of photons in the visible light range. Thus, for example, a light photon that has the energy /Delta1E may dis- place a d xy electron into a dz2 level and in the process be absorbed. z y x dxy z y x dxz z y x dyz (a) z y x dx2\u2212y2 y x dz2 z (b) Fig. 11.3 The five d-orbitals have different geometries (see also Figure 2.3).", "page": 233}

(b) Repulsion of d-electrons by oxygen ions causes splitting of energy levels. The diagonal orbitals t2g have lower energies than those aligned along the axes, eg. If the octahedron is distorted further splitting occurs. In general, there are several polyhedra that can occur in a mineral structure with differ- ent occupancies; also, coordination polyhedra are often distorted, and this distortion causes addi- tional splitting of 3d -orbitals, resulting in many energy levels and thus a complicated absorption behavior, although the splitting discussed above is prevalent. Consider the examples of ruby (corundum, Plate 13b) and emerald (beryl, Plate 15d). Pure corundum has the composition Al 2O3 and pure beryl the composition Be 3Al2Si6O18. Neither of these pure varieties contains transition elements, and therefore they are colorless or white. How- ever, in ruby and emerald, traces of Cr 3+ sub- stitute for octahedral Al 3+, causing crystal \ufb01eld splitting with two absorption peaks in the spec- trum (Figure 11.5). The corundum structure is ionic, and the crystal \ufb01eld splitting is strong. The splitting causes absorption with one peak in vio- let and a second one in yellow. Subtracting yellow and violet from the white spectrum leaves red, orange, and blue, producing the dark red color typical of ruby. In the beryl structure, as in all silicates, there is a covalent component to bond- ing and similar Cr 3+ splitting is weaker than in corundum. Thus absorption bands are displaced towards lower energies and higher wavelengths, with peaks in blue and orange, resulting in the complementary green color in emerald. The crystal \ufb01eld interactions are in\ufb02uenced by several factors, including the speci\ufb01c transi- tion element that is present, its oxidation state, the coordination and exact geometry of the site, and the type of bonding. The amount of the tran- sition element also in\ufb02uences the strength of the color. For example, in ruby only 1--2% chromium creates a dark-red color, and emeralds typically contain up to 0.5% chromium. In other miner- als, crystal \ufb01eld transitions that produce color are due to the major elements present, such as iron (Fe 2+) in the garnet almandine (Fe3Al2(SiO4)3, dark-red color) and olivine ((Mg, Fe)SiO 4, green color). The blue color of turquoise is attributed to crystal \ufb01eld transitions due to copper (Cu 2+). In tourmaline traces of iron (Fe 3+) and Cr 3+ pro- duce a green color and traces of manganese a pink color. In tourmaline crystals from Brazil and Madagascar a variation of trace elements during growth and different concentrations on differ- ent faces can lead to spectacular color zoning (Plate 5c).

When the electron falls back to its lower energy positions, the cations revert to their original charge.

In both examples the energy difference matches the energy of red light that is absorbed, and the resulting color is blue. Mineral ex- amples for Fe 2+ \u21cc Fe3+ transitions are beryl (Be3Al2Si6O18 (as aquamarine)) and cordierite ((Mg)2Al4Si5O18 \u00b7 nH2O), and for Ti 4+ \u21cc Fe2+ transitions examples are kyanite (Al 2SiO5)a n d corundum (Al2O3 (as sapphire)). In all these cases the chromophore elements occur only as traces. In some minerals, color is caused by struc- tural defects, most commonly vacancies or inter- stitial impurities that constitute color centers.I n \ufb02uorite (CaF 2), for example, a \ufb02uorine atom may be missing because it was knocked out by high- energy radiation, or because of excess Ca 2+ dur- ing growth. An electron then substitutes for F\u2212 to maintain charge balance (Figure 11.6). This free electron is controlled by surrounding ions and can exist in different energy levels. Movement of electrons between these states can cause absorp- tion colors and also fluorescence, which is emis- sion of visible light of different wavelength.

In smoky quartz, some Si 4+ are replaced by Al 3+, usually coupled with some interstitial H + to maintain neutrality (Figure 11.7). Radiation can expel an electron from an oxygen ion adjacent to Al 3+, and the resulting unpaired electron in oxygen can have different energy levels, similar to the free electron in \ufb02uorite. In amethyst (Plate 7a) and citrine, traces of iron produce color centers. Both colors are apparent in the sector-zoned vari- ety ametrine (Plate 5d). Intense radiation (such as /H9253-rays) with an energy of at least /Delta1E 1 is necessary to dislodge electrons (Figure 11.8) to an excited state X, but less energetic radiation (such as sun- light) of an energy /Delta1E 2 suf\ufb01ces to overcome an activation barrier and return the electron to its stable ground state G.

It takes lower energy radiation to overcome the threshold to return the structure to the ground state. Fluorescence and phosphorescence When \ufb02uorite (and many other minerals) are ir- radiated with ultraviolet radiation, they re-emit light in the visible range. This behavior, named after the observations on \ufb02uorite, has been called fluorescence,a n di sg e n e r a l l ya p p l i e dt ot h ep r o - cess of emission of electromagnetic radiation produced by energy transitions, not just in the visible range. Fluorescence is a special case of luminescence where energy transitions have been caused by incident electromagnetic radiation. There are other causes of luminescence, such as chemical reactions, radioactive decay, or an elec- tric current. Fluorescence and phosphorescence differ only in the amount of time it takes for electrons to return to their ground states. With \ufb02uores- cence, vacant lower energy positions are \ufb01lled within small fractions of a second. Phosphores- cent materials, however, continue emitting light signi\ufb01cantly after the exciting radiation has been turned off, sometimes for hours. Since the process of displacing electrons into higher energy con\ufb01gurations absorbs electromag- netic radiation, then, as the electrons return to the ground state, they emit radiation. The emit- ted radiation is always of lower energy than the radiation used to displace the electron, and of a speci\ufb01c wavelength, corresponding to the differ- ence between the excited state and the ground state. This process is most transparent for X-rays and we have discussed it brie\ufb02y in Chapter 7. Many transitions contribute to \ufb02uorescence in the visible range, and the spectra are not as sharp as those in the X-ray range. In addition, simi- lar to color, visible \ufb02uorescence depends criti- cally on trace elements and defects but is nev- ertheless a diagnostic property used in mineral identi\ufb01cation and even for prospecting in the \ufb01eld. Common activator elements are chromium, manganese, uranium, and tungsten, while other elements such as iron, cobalt, and nickel sup- press \ufb02uorescence. Plate 5e shows a group of white \ufb02uorite crystals in ordinary light. When ir- radiated with short wavelength (ultraviolet) light, violet radiation is emitted (Plate 5f). Another example of a mineral with strong \ufb02uorescence is scheelite (CaWO 4), an important tungsten ore that is dif\ufb01cult to distinguish from carbonates in hand specimens (Plate 6a) but is immediately recognized by bright white \ufb02uorescence when irradiated with ultraviolet light (Plate 6b). Diamond, when irradiated with high energy X-rays, produces green-yellow \ufb02uores- cence, with the intensity depending on defects in the structure (cf. Plate 9b). A list of mineral examples showing strong ultraviolet \ufb02uorescence or phosphorescence is given in Table 11.2.

In crystals with metallic bonding, energy gaps between ground states and excited states of electrons are very small and vari- able. There are a large number of possible excited states with energies in the range of the visible spectrum. This means that light photons of most wavelengths are immediately absorbed at the sur- face of the crystal and then re-emitted as visible light, resulting in almost complete re\ufb02ection. In ionic and covalent crystals, these band gaps are not available and light enters the crystal. Minerals with nonmetallic luster are, in general, light colored and transmit light, at least to some extent. The different qualities of nonmetallic lus- ter depend on the refractive index, with a high index associated with brilliant luster as in di- amond. Nonmetallic luster can be divided into varieties such as vitreous (glassy luster), pearly (displaying iridescence effects parallel to cleav- age planes), greasy (oily-like luster caused by mi- croscopically rough surfaces resulting from irreg- ular fracture), or adamantine (brilliant luster due to a high dispersion and refractive index). Microstructure Submicroscopic microstructural features, espe- cially if they are periodic, often add very char- acteristic color effects. Several examples are well known for their striking visual appeal. Dispersed inclusions of hematite in the silica variety jasper, for example, add a sparkling golden-brown effect, called tiger-eye.

Every mineralogist must be able to use a pet- rographic microscope to identify minerals in thin sections, or opaque minerals in polished sections, and to determine their associations and inter- growths. A quick look at a thin section provides a wealth of information about the geological his- tory of an assemblage of minerals. For example Figure 12.1a is olivine basalt, recognizable by phe- nocrysts of olivine and plagioclase of labradorite composition, and by a \ufb01ne groundmass. Figure 12.1b is a metamorphic amphibolite with horn- blende, plagioclase (An 50), and biotite. The pla- gioclase composition in this metamorphic rock indicates that it is of similar bulk chemical com- position to the basalt, crystallized at 600--700 \u25e6C \u2217 Optional reading for those who plan mineralogical laboratory work. and 400--600 MPa. The alignment of the horn- blende crystals suggests that crystallization was associated with tectonic deformation. While thin sections are indispensable and provide a \ufb01rst characterization, the microscopic technique of observing mineral grains in immer- sion oil to check the refractive index and op- tical character is also fast and often provides identi\ufb01cation. The petrographic microscope fur- nishes some immediate answers to mineralogical inquiries. Other techniques, which we will dis- cuss in this chapter, are more involved and re- quire more sophisticated equipment and sample preparation. Mineralogists must be familiar with X-ray powder diffraction, a very important and reliable laboratory technique for mineral identi\ufb01cation (see Chapter 7). X-ray powder diffractometers are available in many university geology depart- ments, in most mining companies, and in ma- terials science laboratories. While the method is used mainly for identi\ufb01cation purposes, it can also be used to determine precise lattice param- eters that may be indicative of composition and the history of formation of a mineral. Crystal structure determination is a more special- ized application of X-ray diffraction. Originally it was based largely on diffraction data from single crystals (see e.g., Stout and Jensen, 1989).

Today it is pursued mainly in chemistry, where new crystalline compounds are produced every day and methods have been streamlined and automated. Nonetheless, a ma- jor application in mineralogy is the structural characterization of industrial zeolites. Taking advantage of the high intensity and collimation of synchrotron X-rays, combined with diamond anvil pressure cells, it has become possible to re\ufb01ne crystal structures of minerals at temperature and pressure conditions corre- sponding to those at the center of the earth. For special applications, neutron, rather than X-ray diffraction, has distinct advantages. Neutrons are barely absorbed by most elements and penetrate not only large samples but also pressure vessels and heating devices, making in situ experiments much easier. Clearly the chemical composition of a mineral is of utmost importance and many techniques are available for such studies. Traditionally, miner- als were dissolved in acids such as hydrochloric or hydro\ufb02uoric and various reagents were added to the solution for gravimetric, calorimetric, or titrational analyses of the different elements. Today wet-chemical analyses are often replaced by physical methods. One example is the use of atomic absorption and emission to identify light elements such as sodium and potassium, par- ticularly in solutions. Another example is X-ray \ufb02uorescence, which is applied widely in quanti- tative analyses of solid minerals and rocks and is very sensitive for trace elements. Perhaps the most important instrument for modern miner- alogical research is the electron microprobe. It has become an indispensable instrument for de- termining local compositions of a grain, or vari- ations within a grain, on areas less than 30 /H9262m in diameter. Unfortunately, electron microprobes are available only in selected laboratories. Despite the movement towards physical methods, there is still some need for conventional chemical analy- ses, for example to determine the water content of minerals, the oxidation state of iron, and the carbon dioxide content of carbonates and scapo- lites. Other more specialized techniques have added immense information on the nature and origins of minerals. Two types of electron micro- scopes are commonly applied. The scanning elec- tron microscope (SEM) studies crystal surfaces at high magni\ufb01cation. It can be used to determine morphology and compositional variations on a very \ufb01ne scale (<1 /p109m). Thetransmission electron microscope (TEM) is the analog of the transmission light microscope and provides information about the internal structure of a specimen thin enough to be transparent to the electron beam. The TEM is used to investigate microstructures and defects, such as dislocations, antiphase bound- aries, exsolution lamellae, and microtwins.

The electron microscope is the primary instrument used today in environmental laboratories involved in asbestos identi\ufb01cation. There are a whole range of so-called spectro- scopic techniques that use energy transitions of electrons or vibrations of atoms or molecules to derive information on the composition and struc- tural state. With infrared spectroscopy the hydro- gen speciation in minerals can be determined (H +,O H \u2212 or H 2O). Raman spectroscopy is used to investigate the nature of chemical bonding. In the following sections we discuss brie\ufb02y some principles and capabilities of the most im- portant experimental methods, dividing the dis- cussion into diffraction, high resolution imaging, chemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques. Admittedly this is a very brief overview, illustrat- ing for which purposes the various techniques can be used. For additional details, the literature needs to be consulted. (Important monographs are listed under \u2018\u2018Further reading\u201d at the end of this chapter.) Diffraction X-ray diffraction and synchrotron X-rays X-ray diffraction has been discussed extensively in Chapter 7. In most experiments single crystals or powders are irradiated with monochromatic X-rays of wavelengths between 0.07 and 0.2 nm (1 nm = 10 \u02daA), depending on the anode material of the X-ray tube. In a diffraction pattern, the location of the peak (i.e., the Bragg angle \u03b8 in the case of a powder) is related to the lattice pa- rameters, and the intensity of a diffraction peak depends on the position of atoms in the unit cell. Powder diffraction is the standard method of mineral identi\ufb01cation, which is a straightforward procedure for single-phase materials, but can also be used to identify mixtures of several minerals, including their volume proportions. Figure 12.2a shows a diffraction pattern of an impure lime- stone with calcite, dolomite, and quartz. While X-ray powder diffractometers are widely available, another type of X-ray source, a synchrotron, is limited to large facilities. How- ever, for special applications it may be neces- sary to use the very intense and highly focused X-ray beams of synchrotrons. Synchrotron X-rays are produced by a continuous release of energy when electrons are accelerated in a storage ring to speeds close to that of light, and their tra- jectory is de\ufb02ected by a magnetic \ufb01eld. A syn- chrotron beam can have an intensity more than 10 orders of magnitude greater than a conven- tional X-ray tube and microbeams can be pro- duced that probe areas less than a micrometer in diameter. Unlike X-rays produced by conven- tional X-ray tubes, synchrotron X-rays have a broad and continuous energy (or wavelength) range.

Neutrons also have a wave character, with a wavelength range similar to that used for X-ray diffraction (see e.g., Bacon, 1975). Access to neu- trons is limited, since neutrons are produced by nuclear reactors or accelerators, which are available only in large national facilities and not in individual mineralogical research labora- tories. Nevertheless, because of their unique ad- vantages, mineralogists often travel to those fa- cilities to perform experiments. In this section we will look at some of the differences between neutron and X-ray diffraction and illustrate some applications.

Boron and cadmium are exceptions and those elements are used for shielding. This reduction in absorption has the related disadvan- tage that scattering is much reduced. Compound- ing this problem is the low intensity of neutron beams, requiring long exposure times. For these reasons, neutron diffraction is used only to deter- mine material properties that cannot be obtained by other means. When neutrons are scattered by matter, the process can alter both the momentum and the energy of the neutrons. Nuclei in a crystal are not rigidly \ufb01xed (Figure 12.5a), but rather are moving to some extent in the form of wave-like displace- ments, with a wavelength of the order of tens of unit cells (Figure 12.5b). Scattering of incom- ing neutrons is not purely elastic, and nuclei can recoil during the collision with a neutron, partic- ularly if the wavelength of the neutron is similar to the wavelength of the lattice vibration. With inelastic neutron scattering we can get information about lattice vibrations. Elastic scattering is used to analyze the equi- librium atomic structure, in much the same way as with X-rays. Since neutron diffraction depends on nuclear forces, different isotopes scatter dif- ferently. An extreme case is that of hydrogen and deuterium, where the scattering factors have op- posite signs. The scattering power of some atoms and their isotopes, represented as spheres with different radii, is shown in Figure 12.6. This \ufb01g- ure highlights again the monotonous increase in scattering power with atomic number for X-rays (top) but the very irregular behavior for neutrons. Isotopes with negative scattering amplitudes are white circles. One method of producing neutrons is in a nu- clear reactor by means of \ufb01ssion of atoms (largely uranium) in the reactor fuel (Figure 12.7a). An- other method is with an accelerator. Accelerated high-energy protons collide with a heavy-metal target, such as tungsten, and during the col- lisions spallation neutrons are released (Figure 12.7b). The protons arrive in bursts, and spalla- tion neutrons are generated in pulses of 20 to 50 per second. This pulsed character makes it pos- sible to record the timespan between the genera- tion of the neutron and its arrival in the detector. The velocity v is related to", "page": 244}

Neutrons, unlike X-ray photons, have a mag- netic moment, and this property can be used to determine magnetic structures, such as the alignment of magnetic dipoles in magnetite and manganese oxide (see Chapter 8). An additional bene\ufb01t is that, because of the low absorption, en- vironmental cells can easily be placed in the neu- tron beam, allowing phase transformations to be studied in situ at high and low temperature and high pressure. High-resolution imaging Transmission electron microscopy We have discussed light microscopy in Chapter 9. Since visible light has a wavelength range of 400--700 nm, we can at best resolve features larger than 1000 nm = 1 /H9262m. This value is very large compared with the size of the unit cell, or even more with the size of interatomic distances, and for details we need to use radiation with a shorter wavelength. Short wavelength X-rays and /H9253-rays, unfortunately, cannot be used for imaging because the refractive index of matter for those wavelengths is close to 1.0 and this means that no lenses can be designed. This situation leads us to consider accelerated electrons. The energy E of an accelerated electron is E = Ve = 1 2 mv2, where V is the electric poten- tial, e the charge of the electron, m the mass and v the velocity. In diffraction, electron microscopy, and particularly in spectroscopy, different energy units are used to characterize radiation. Box 12.1 gives some correspondences and summarizes re- lationships. The wavelength \u03bb of an accelerated electron is given again by the de Broglie equation 12.1a \u03bb = h/mv = h/\u221a(2mV e) = \u221a(1.5/V (in volts)) nm (12.1b) (This is not strictly correct because the mass varies with velocity and a relativistic correction needs to be applied.) In any case wavelengths are very short (0.0037 nm for 100 kV and 0.00087 nm for 1000 kV). In contrast to /H9253-rays of similar wavelength, accelerated electrons have a charge, and their path can be changed by an electric \ufb01eld. Therefore, one can construct electromag- netic lenses that work in a manner analogous to that of optical lenses. The limit of resolution of an electron microscope is not determined by the wavelength but by the spherical aberration of the lens, and for the highest resolution micro- scopes it lies in the range of 0.1 nm, similar to the size of atoms.

The fundamental optical principles of image formation by the objective lens are the same as those in a light microscope (Figure 9.10a). By means of a condenser lens, a beam of elec- trons is focused on the specimen. After the beam has passed through an objective lens an enlarged \ufb01rst intermediate image is formed. This is further enlarged by an intermediate lens to form a sec- ond intermediate image, and again by a projector lens to a \ufb01nal highly enlarged image that can be viewed on a \ufb02uorescing phosphor screen, record- ed on a photographic \ufb01lm, or captured digitally. Contrast in the image arises from interac- tion of the accelerated electrons with the crystal. As you can imagine, the contrast is particularly high around defects in the crystal where the lo- cal charge balance is disturbed and electrons are de\ufb02ected. Therefore, the TEM is the ideal instru- ment to image structural defects such as dislo- cations, twin boundaries, and antiphase bound- aries (see Chapter 6, where some TEM images of such defects have been shown). In Figure 12.9a we show twin boundaries (TB) and antiphase bound- aries (APB) in perovskite, all of which appear as bright lines. APBs display fringes. However, since we are dealing with waves in- teracting with a crystal lattice, image formation is really more complex and can be viewed as a 2- fold diffraction process. A \ufb01rst diffraction pattern of the object is formed in the back focal plane of the objective lens. The waves continue their travel after the diffraction pattern to form a mag- ni\ufb01ed intermediate image of the object. If the strength of the intermediate lens is reduced, a second diffraction pattern (see Figure 12.8b), in- stead of a second intermediate image (see Figure 12.8a), is produced in the back focal plane of the intermediate lens. This second intermedi- ate diffraction pattern is then projected onto the imaging device by the projector lens. Figure 12.9b shows the single-crystal diffraction pattern of perovskite, corresponding to the image in Figure 12.9a. Each spot corresponds to diffrac- tion on a lattice plane hkl and can be labeled accordingly. From the distances and angles be-", "page": 247}

While contrast from defects is generally ex- pressed as dark lines, and in some cases as bright lines on a gray background, diffraction on the lat- tice also produces contrast that is present even in a perfect crystal. So-called Bragg fringes (labeled BF in Figure 12.9a) are associated with diffraction on a set of lattice planes and depend on orientation and thickness. They usually are more or less par- allel to an edge. When a crystal is tilted relative to the beam, Bragg fringes move, whereas contrast from defects may change the appearance but will stay in a particular location.", "page": 247}

With the objective aperture (or diffraction aperture) we can reduce the number of hkl rays that contribute to the image. Usually just one hkl or only the primary electron beam is se- lected.

We demonstrate the use of the objective aperture for the case of the carbonate mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO 3)2), which has small domains of a calcium-rich phase with an ordered super- structure. The strong spots on the diffraction pat- tern inserted in Figure 12.10 are due to the basic dolomite structure. The weak and elongated re- \ufb02ections halfway in between are due to the super- structure with a different ordering scheme. An image can be formed with the primary electron beam as illustrated in Figure 12.11a. This is called a brightfield image. Alternatively, an aperture can be placed around a particular diffraction spot hkl, excluding the primary beam (Figure 12.11b). Such a darkfield image contains primarily infor- mation from structural features contributing to the diffraction spot. For example, Figure 12.10 is a dark\ufb01eld image of dolomite with the aper- ture placed on a weak diffraction spot (arrow) representing an ordering structure in dolomite.

The lower voltage implies less sam- ple penetration, and thus SEM images can pro- vide only information about the few micrometers immediately below the surface. The images are composed of signals recorded at different spots, with no lens system beyond the sample. Because of this there is a large depth of focus, and the SEM is widely used for investigations of surface morphology. There are various types of signals produced by the electron beam.

Figure 12.15b is a BE image illustrating oscillatory zon- ing of plagioclase with regions rich in calcium (high atomic number) appearing brighter. There are other signals that are sometimes explored. Incident electrons produce electronic transitions in the sample. If the transitions involve inner electrons, characteristic X-rays are emitted that give information on chemical composition and an X-ray map of calcium atoms illustrates the con- centric zoning structure with highest number in the center and on the edges (Figure 12.15c). If transitions involve bonding electrons associated with color centers, visible light may be emitted (cathodoluminescence, CL) and indeed the CL im- age best depicts growth zones (Figure 12.15d). In addition, BEs produce a diffraction pattern that can be used for identi\ufb01cation and determination of crystal orientation. The SEM has many applications in mineralogy and is the ideal instrument to document sample morphology and compositional variations. Com- pared with the action of the TEM, larger surfaces can be surveyed. Atomic force microscopy An entirely different way to investigate the sur- face structure of a crystal, down to atomic resolu- tion, is atomic force microscopy (AFM), which has only recently been invented. A tip, consisting of a sharp fragment of diamond or silicon nitride crystal and mounted on a \ufb02exible cantilever, is brought into close contact (<20 \u02daA) with the sam- ple (Figure 12.16). If atoms in the sample and on the tip are in very close contact, then electro- static repulsion by van der Waals forces occurs. This repulsion balances any applied force and the cantilever bends rather than forcing the atoms in the crystal tip closer to the sample atoms. The de\ufb02ection of the cantilever is determined with a laser beam that is re\ufb02ected on the back side of the cantilever, recording the light signal with a split photodiode detector. The sample is scanned under the tip with piezoelectric translators in the x, y,a n d z directions. The force at the tip is held constant by lowering or raising the posi- tion of the tip, and the corresponding variations in z as a function of x and y produce an image that expresses the surface topography. The max- imum resolving power of an AFM is 10 \u02daAi nt h e plane of the sample and 1 \u02daA perpendicular to the surface. With this resolution it is possible to im- age the arrangement of individual atoms as in the surface of a muscovite crystal (Figure 12.17).

An SEM that is optimized for quantitative chemical analysis, rather than imaging, is the electron microprobe (Figure 12.19). In the elec- tron microprobe, electrons are accelerated to 10--20 keV. An electron beam about 10 /H9262mi n diameter is focused on the sample by means of a condenser--objective lens system. The sam- ple consists of a \ufb02at polished surface, and emit- ted X-rays are analyzed. There are two types of detector. Energy-dispersive detectors use a semi- conductor crystal that converts X-ray photons to electric pulses that vary with photon energy. The pulses are then processed and identi\ufb01ed ac- cording to energy. This technique is fast but", "page": 254}

The X-rays of variable wavelength diffract on an an- alyzer crystal with known d-spacing (e.g., (0002) of graphite at d = 3.36 \u02daA). A detector scans the \u03b8 angle range, but this time the wavelength is un- known and the d-spacing is \ufb01xed. The electron microprobe provides relative numbers of atomic concentrations. In order to get absolute data, spectra of unknown samples need to be com- pared with known standards measured under identical conditions. Quantitative analyses with the electron microprobe are generally limited to elements with atomic number of sodium or higher, although some instruments can even an- alyze oxygen. Major elements, present in concen- trations of 0.05 weight% or higher, are measured easily. Small trace amounts are more dif\ufb01cult to quantify. It is also dif\ufb01cult to distinguish between ions in different oxidation states such as Fe 2+ and Fe3+. X-ray \ufb02uorescence X-ray \ufb02uorescence (XRF) also makes use of \ufb02u- orescence of X-rays due to characteristic energy transitions, but unlike an X-ray tube or an elec- tron microprobe, high-energy polychromatic X- rays (rather than electrons) are used to excite elec- trons in the sample. While electrons are easily absorbed and require a vacuum, X-rays are much less absorbed and many analyses can be done without a vacuum. In addition, the X-ray beam is much larger than an electron beam, allowing larger samples to be analyzed and thus provid- ing good statistics, both in terms of grain aver- ages and counting statistics. The \ufb01rst aspect (i.e., sample size) is important because it allows us to analyze rocks, usually in the form of powders, and XRF has indeed become the most important method for quantitative rock analysis. The sec- ond aspect (i.e., counting statistics) is signi\ufb01cant because it makes XRF very sensitive for trace el- ement analysis, in the parts per million (ppm) range.

Emission spectroscopic methods are restricted by the limited sensitivity of the excitation process. The situation is much improved for ab- sorption of light by neutral atoms. An absorption spectrometer consists of a light source that emits a line spectrum of the elements of interest. A liq- uid (or, more rarely, a solid) sample is sprayed into a \ufb02ame of a suf\ufb01ciently high temperature to decompose crystals and molecules into atoms with electrons in the ground state. As in an opti- cal emission system, light is dispersed and the intensity of the spectral lines after absorption by the atomic gas is recorded. In an atomic ab- sorption spectrometer the decrease in light inten- sity corresponds to the amount of the element present. Mass spectrometry Chemical analyses can also be done with a mass spectrometer. In this procedure, the sample is va- porized and the vapor is introduced into an ion- ization chamber (Figure 12.22), where the atoms are ionized. The ions are then accelerated, and the ion beam is injected into a magnetic \ufb01eld. The magnetic \ufb01eld de\ufb02ects the path of the ions to follow the curvature of an analyzer tube. The amount of de\ufb02ection depends on the mass and on the charge of the ions, lighter ions being de- \ufb02ected more than heavier ions. Those within a certain weight range will strike a detector at the Fig. 12.22 Mass spectrometer in which ions of different weight are de\ufb02ected by a magnet. far end of the instrument. Each ion that arrives in the detector produces a pulse in current and the strength of the electric current is related to the amount of ion present. Since mass spectrometers are sensitive to mass (rather than electron transitions), they can be used to measure relative amounts of different isotopes of elements in minerals and are applied mainly to radiometric dating and determination of stable isotopes. Spectroscopic techniques Spectroscopic techniques analyze energy differ- ences between a ground state and excited states (Figure 12.23). We have already discussed the gen- eral principle of these techniques in chapters on X-ray diffraction (see Chapter 7) and color (see Chapter 11), as well as in the previous section on X-ray \ufb02uorescence. To summarize, an incident beam of radiation is either absorbed by mat- ter or can cause emission or scattering of radi- ation from the material. Absorption and emis- sion of energy arises if the incident radiation causes changes in the energy level (electronic, vi- brational, or nuclear). The energy E is related to frequency \u03bd, or wavelength \u03bb, according to the equation E = h\u03bd = hc /\u03bb (12.1c)", "page": 256}
{"text": "234 ADVANCED ANALYTICAL METHODS DE Ee Eg Incoming radiation Emitted radiation EmissionAbsorption Fig. 12.23 Energy of incoming radiation is preferentially absorbed by creating an excited state with higher energy E e. As the system returns to the ground state with energy E g, the gained energy is emitted as radiation. The energies of absorption and emission are characteristic of structural features. where h is the Planck constant and c is the velocity of light in vacuum. Depending on the application, either energies (in kJ/mol or eV), frequencies (in Hz, i.e., in s \u22121), wavelengths (in \u02daAo rp r e f e r a b l yi nn m ) ,o rw a v en u m b e r s( t h e inverse of the wavelength, in cm \u22121) are used (see Box 12.1). The energy differences between ground and excited states cover a wide range of the fre- quency/wavelength spectrum from radio waves (10 6 Hz/102 m) to /H9253-rays (10 20 Hz/10\u221212 m). In the lowest energy range are transitions associated with different spin levels of nuclei. Energy transi- tions due to vibrations of molecular groups cor- respond to infrared radiation, while transitions of inner shell electrons correspond to X-rays. With spectroscopic methods the local structural environments of atoms in crystals can be investi- gated, and these environments in particular are sensitive to changes during phase transforma- tions. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy both in- volve the use of light to investigate the vi- brational behavior of crystals (e.g., the stretch- ing of bonds, and the rotations of molecules such as water). Vibrational spectra occur typically in the approximate energy range 0--80 kJ/mol (0--4000 cm \u22121). They give information on struc- tural properties such as symmetry, bond lengths and angles, and coordination polyhedra. These spectra are also used widely in identi\ufb01cation of molecules and of coordination polyhedra in crys- tals with strong covalent bonds, such as H 2O, CO3,S O4, and SiO 4. In infrared absorption spectroscopy, broadband IR radiation is passed through a sample and the in- tensity of the transmitted light is measured as a function of wavelength (Figure 12.24a). Absorp- tion occurs at speci\ufb01c frequencies (or wave num- bers, measured in cm \u22121), corresponding to the energy differences /Delta1E between the vibrational energy levels. In a Raman experiment an incident monochro- matic laser beam with a fairly high energy in the visible range (20 000 cm \u22121 wave numbers) is passed through the sample and the scat- tered light is analyzed by a spectrometer (Figure 12.24b). The incident photon with energy E ex- cites the investigated system (molecule or crys- tal) to a short-lived (<10 \u221214 s) \u2018\u2018virtual state\u2019\u2019 V0 or V1, which decays with the release of a pho- ton (Figure 12.25, top).

Two vi- brational modes in Figure 12.25, top, n = 0a n d n = 1 are raised to energies V 0 and V1, respec- tively, by the incident photons, releasing pho- tons with energies E + /Delta1E and E \u2212 /Delta1E .

Since the population of molecules is larger at n = 0 than at n = 1, the Stokes lines are always stronger than anti-Stokes lines, and it is cus- tomary to measure Stokes lines in Raman spec- troscopy. Only the absolute energy shift with re- spect to the Rayleigh line is given, and, as in IR absorption spectroscopy, these shifts are usually expressed as wave numbers (cm \u22121).

{"text": "236 ADVANCED ANALYTICAL METHODS Box 12.2 Infrared and Raman spectroscopy of calcite A more complicated case illustrating the difference between infrared (IR) ab- sorption spectroscopy and Raman scattering spectroscopy is provided by the CO 2\u2212 3 groups in crystals of carbonates. In crystals with molecular ions (e.g., car- bonates, borates, sulfates, and others) the molecular groups have strong covalent bonding and are only weakly disturbed by neighboring cations. Distortions of the CO 2\u2212 3 group gives rise to high-frequency vibrations within the molecule (so-called internal vibrations). These vibrations have energies that are very characteristic of the molecule and are easy to identify. There are also low-frequency vibrations owing to the interaction of the molecule with other ions. These external modes consist not of distortions of the molecular group but rather of librations (rotations) or translations of the whole group with respect to the other ions of the crystal. The external modes are structure speci\ufb01c but are more dif\ufb01cult to attribute. Figure 12.27 compares an IR absorption spectrum (a) and a Raman scattering spectrum (b) of calcite. IR has some low-frequency absorption bands and Raman some scattering peaks that are characteristic of calcite. There are also peaks at high frequencies due to the internal modes of CO 2\u2212 3 . The free triangular CO2\u2212 3 group has four internal modes of vibration and thus four different vibrational frequencies (Figure 12.28, left side). In a calcite crystal there are two CO2\u2212 3 groups in the unit cell, and vibrations are coupled with two possibilities for each mode, one in which the pairs vibrate the same way (left) and one where the vibrations are opposite (right). A stretching of oxygen atoms (Figure 12.28a) does not polarize the molecule, and there is no infrared absorption for the 1087 cm \u22121 frequency. However, if the two CO2\u2212 3 groups stretch in tandem, polarizability produces a strong Raman peak at 1088 cm\u22121 (peaks are slightly shifted, compared to the free CO 2\u2212 3 frequency owing to the in\ufb02uence of the environment in a crystal). Mode 2 (Figure 12.28b) shifts oxygen charges relative to carbon, and, if two groups are vibrating in the same direction, this produces a shift in overall charges and absorption of electromagnetic waves. This mode is sensitive to IR, though not to Raman. Indeed there is a signal near 879 cm \u22121 in the IR spectrum only. The two remaining modes (Figure 12.28c,d) produce both an IR and a Raman signal, depending on whether the displacements are opposite (IR) or equal (Raman). There are peaks for these modes, both in the IR and in the Raman spectra near 1432 cm \u22121 and 714 cm\u22121. There are numerous other applications of IR and Raman spectroscopy in mineralogy. For ex- ample, Raman spectroscopy has been applied ex- tensively to identify gases inside \ufb02uid inclusions (such as CO 2,H 2S, CO, CH4, and especially N2,O 2 which have no IR signature).

Multiple weak absorption peaks at 2250 nm are caused by OH groups substituting for oxygen. Raman spectroscopy has been used in the destruction-free analysis of gemstones, particularly in determining whether gems are naturally grown or synthetic.

On the other hand IR spectra are easier to interpret quantitatively and are preferred in determinations of, for ex- ample, the amount and speciation of water in minerals. In a loose sense, IR spectroscopy is used to determine how much of a vibrational molecule (e.g., H 2O or OH) is present in a struc- ture, whereas Raman scattering gives informa- tion about the detailed structure causing the vi- brations. X-ray absorption spectroscopy We have already mentioned that energy transi- tions of inner shell electrons result in emission of radiation in the X-ray wavelength range and that this phenomenon is used for chemical anal- ysis. Overall, X-ray absorption by matter increases with increasing wavelength (decreasing energy), but there are some sharp peaks in the absorption spectrum at energies corresponding to displace- ments of electrons. The ejection of an electron from the ground state is not a simple process if an atom is surrounded by neighboring atoms and depends on the arrangements of those neigh- bor atoms. Therefore absorption edges are not sharp but display a \ufb01ne structure with regular modulations (Figure 12.30). While the location of the absorption edge is characteristic of the ele- ment (see e.g., Figure 12.18), details in the pre- edge depend on the oxidation state and details in the smoothly undulating decreasing intensity provide information about the local structural environment of the absorbing atom (XANES, X-ray absorption near edge structure). Further away from the edge, modulations arise from interference effects of scattered electron waves with neighboring atoms. Such an extended X- ray absorption \ufb01ne structure (EXAFS) spectrum, generally measured with synchrotron X-rays with tunable energy, can be interpreted by inverting the pattern, thus providing a radial distribution function. This curve gives the probability of \ufb01nd- ing a second atom as a function of distance from the absorbing atom. For example, manganese ox- ides have characteristic octahedral coordination with Mn--O distances of 1.9 \u02daA and correspond- ingly a large peak in the distribution function (Figure 12.31). There are additional peaks at 2.8 \u02daA and 3.4 \u02daA corresponding to Mn--Mn distances (indicated by arrows). The 2.8 \u02daA distance cor- responds to the distance of cations in edge- sharing octahedra (e.g., as illustrated for the NaCl", "page": 260}

Nuclear magnetic resonance Atomic nuclei have a positive electric charge and can be thought of as spinning around an axis. Such spinning of a charged particle produces a magnetic \ufb01eld. The magnetic dipole that forms is described with the nuclear spin quantum num- ber m s. For nuclei with even mass numbers, the value of ms is 0 and there is no magnetic moment. Nuclei with odd mass numbers have m s = n/2, where n is an integer (e.g., 17O: 5 2 , 27Al: 5 2 , 29Si: 1 2 ), and there is a magnetic moment. In the absence of an external magnetic \ufb01eld, all spin states of the nucleus have the same en- ergy. An applied magnetic \ufb01eld interacts with the magnetic moment of the nucleus and splits the energy levels into groups. If m s = 1 2 there are two energy levels, \u22121 2 and +1 2 , and the nucleus be- haves as a magnetic dipole. By placing a sample in a large static magnetic \ufb01eld and applying ra- dio frequency radiation, a split of the energy level is produced that increases with increasing mag- netic \ufb01eld (Figure 12.33). Magnetic resonance oc- curs if the applied radio frequency is equal to the energy difference between the spin levels. The ex- act resonance frequency of an isotope depends on the local chemical and crystallographic environ- ment because electrons in the near environment shield the nucleus to varying degrees from the applied magnetic \ufb01eld. The resonance spectrum therefore contains information about the envi- ronment of atoms, and it can be used, for exam- ple, to determine the occupancy of an element in different structural sites.

In contrast, M \u00a8ossbauer spectroscopy ana- lyzes the core nuclear energy levels of speci\ufb01c ex- cited atomic nuclei, and these energy differences are very large, corresponding to /H9253-rays. When /H9253- radiation is absorbed or emitted by an atomic nu- cleus, the momentum of the system must be pre- served. The recoil of the nucleus emitting /H9253-rays thus changes the energy (frequency) of the emit- ted radiation. Under special circumstances and only for certain nuclei, recoil-free absorption and emission may take place, with sharp resonance of the energy.

If the nucleus in the source and the sample has the same environment and the source is stationary with respect to the sample, i.e., the nucleus is unperturbed, resonant absorption will occur at the 14.4 keV energy (Figure 12.36a). If the environment is different, a shift occurs (isomer or chemical shift) that depends on the energy differences between source and absorber nuclei, such as difference in valence state, spin state and coordination of the absorber atom (Figure 12.36b). This shift can be used to investigate oxi- dation state and the coordination of 57Fe in the mineral sample. In the spectrum one observes a single line that is shifted by \u03b4 from the reference point. We have already discussed splitting of energy levels of atoms with d-electrons in the context of colors (see Figure 11.4). This splitting depends on the valence and spin state of the absorber atom, as well as on coordination and distortion of the crystallographic site (Figure 12.36c).

The most important application of M\u00a8ossbauer spectroscopy for minerals has been the determi- nation of oxidation states of iron. Such analysis cannot be done with X-ray diffraction. Since the isomer shift increases with coordination num- ber, even trace amounts of iron can be identi- \ufb01ed on individual sites. This is illustrated for gar- net in Figure 12.37. The spectrum has a large quadrupole doublet (at \u22120.7 and 3.0 mm/s) cor- responding to Fe 2+ (ferrous iron) in the dodeca- hedral site (92% relative area), and a smaller one (at 0.3 mm/s) corresponding to Fe 3+ (ferric iron) in the octahedral site (8% relative area). The area is directly proportional to the amounts present. M\u00a8ossbauer spectroscopy has been used exten- sively to study Fe 2+/Mg distribution in pyroxenes (chain silicates) and other minerals as a func- tion of temperature.

{"text": "Chapter 13 Mechanical properties and deformation Stress\u2013strain In Chapter 8 we explored the intrinsic physi- cal properties of minerals that uniquely relate physical quantities and are described by a sin- gle number or a set of coef\ufb01cients. Density, ther- mal conductivity, and elastic properties are ex- amples. These properties depend on composition and structure and may vary slightly with temper- ature and pressure. The mechanical properties of minerals are more complicated because they are greatly modi\ufb01ed during a crystal\u2019s history. In this chapter we will explore how crystals deform. We start our discussion with a few basic de\ufb01- nitions. If we apply a compressive force F to the surface of a crystal, we impose a deformation apparent in a change in length ( /Delta1l) and corre- spondingly by a change in area (Figure 13.1a). Force per surface area is called stress \u03c3, and the resulting deformation (/Delta1l/l) is called strain \u03b5. We have brie\ufb02y introduced stress and strain in Chapter 8 as second-rank tensors. Both properties are highly directional. In Figure 13.1b we show the evolution of strain as a function of applied stress. The stress-- strain curve generally has three segments. In the \ufb01rst segment (regime 1), strain increases al- most linearly with stress. If the stress is removed, the strain returns to its original value. In this re- versible elastic range, deformation occurs by com- pression of bonds and can be described fully with the elastic tensor. No bonds are broken in this regime. In some directions the crystal compresses more easily than in others. If strain is increased further, in regime 2, the stress--strain curve starts to bend and the same increment in stress produces a larger increase in strain. In this region dislocations become active and move freely through the crystal, causing per- manent changes in the microstructure and shape of the crystal. A release of stress in this regime does not return the crystal to its original shape. This irreversible deformation is described as plas- tic or ductile,a n d ,s i n c et h er e q u i r e ds t r e s sf o ra given amount of strain does not increase much, the behavior is known as easy slip. Slip deforma- tion is discussed in more detail in the next sec- tion, and in it we will make use of our earlier dis- cussion of linear defects in Chapter 6. For now, re- call that dislocations are linear defects, and that, on the basis of the lattice distortion, they can be classi\ufb01ed as either edge or screw dislocations. In regime 3, stress increases more rapidly again. This is because dislocations start multiplying and interfering with each other. This regime is called work-hardening. Ultimately, at strain level 4, the material has reached its ultimate strength and fails by fracturing. Deformation by slip Two observations led to the discovery of dislo- cations by G.I. Taylor in 1934. First, it had long been known that when a large stress is applied", "page": 268}

With the propaga- tion of dislocations, such universal instantaneous bond breakage is not necessary. The latter hypothesis by Taylor (which is now universally accepted) is illustrated in Figure 13.3, where a lattice is deformed to a new shape by applying a shear stress that propagates an edge dislocation across the slip plane. At each instant only one bond is broken, but at the end of the process (right side of Figure 13.3), the top half of the crystal has been displaced over the bot- tom half by one lattice unit. Such deformation involves less energy input, and therefore a lesser stress, than that required to produce an instan- taneous offset. Analogies can be seen in the way that a large carpet can be moved easily by prop- agating a ruck (pucker or fold) across the car- pet surface; or in the movement of a caterpillar (Figure 13.4), whereby a hump, beneath which the caterpillar\u2019s pedicles are not in contact with the ground, propagates along the length of the caterpillar, similar to the broken bonds in the dislocation core.", "page": 269}

If the force is perpendicular or parallel to the slip plane, one of the cosines is zero, the resolved shear stress becomes zero, and the crystal cannot be deformed. Figure 13.5b illustrates the Schmid law for a crystal of zinc, the material on which it was \ufb01rst discovered. Deformation occurs only if the resolved shear stress reaches a critical value \u03c4 c. The critical resolved shear stress \u03c4c is a material constant for a given crystal and slip system. Crystals may have a single slip system or may have several slip systems. There are symmetri- cally equivalent slip systems (owing to crystal symmetry), and independent slip systems. Slip systems are described by general notation {hkl} \u27e8uvw\u27e9, which indicates that the slip plane is a member of the form {hkl} and the slip di- rection is symmetrically equivalent to direction [uvw]. For example, {111} \u27e81\u00af10\u27e9 slip in fcc metals is not just on the (111) plane, but also on (11 \u00af1), (1\u00af11), ( \u00af111), and ( \u00af1\u00af11).

(Review Chapters 3 and 4 for nomenclature.) While these 12 slip systems are symmetrically equivalent, they are not equiva- lent with respect to the applied stress and that system for which the resolved shear stress is largest will operate preferentially. If systems are not related by symmetry, for example basal slip (0001) \u27e8\u00af12\u00af10\u27e9 and prismatic slip {10\u00af10} \u27e8\u00af12\u00af10\u27e9 in hcp metals, the different slip systems have differ- ent critical shear stresses that vary with tempera- ture and other factors. In zinc, for example, basal slip has a lower critical shear stress than pris- matic slip at low temperature, whereas at high temperature both systems operate with similar ease. Some important slip systems are listed in Table 13.1. Note that both slip planes and slip directions have generally simple indices, corresponding to lattice planes with large d-spacings and lattice di- rections with closely spaced lattice points.

In the case of fcc metals, the slip plane is the close-packed {111} plane and the slip direction is the close-packed \u27e81\u00af10\u27e9 direction, as we have already discussed in Chap- ter 2 (Figure 2.7). Dislocation microstructures We have seen that dislocations are necessary for ductile deformation of crystals. Dislocations are present in most crystals, and even during ideal crystal growth conditions may reach densities of about 10 6 dislocations/cm2. During deforma- tion the number of dislocations generally mul- tiplies, and one of the mechanisms of such de- formation multiplication is called a Frank--Read source. Assume that a dislocation propagates on a slip plane and runs into two obstacles (A and B in Figure 13.6). These obstacles may be either dislocations that run across the slip plane or in- cluded particles. Under a stress, the segment AB will increasingly bow out, eventually sweeping right around the pinning obstacles and pinching off to create both a loop and a new version of the original segment (labeled A \u2032B\u2032 in Figure 13.6). The process can repeat, creating", "page": 271}

Correspondingly, the stress--strain curve becomes steeper (regime 3 in Figure 13.1b). When the stress reaches a critical limit, the crystal will fail by rupture. At low temperatures, the movement of dislo- cations is restricted to the particular slip planes, and dislocations are often concentrated in slip or deformation bands (Figure 13.7c).

{"text": "250 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND DEFORMATION (a) (b) (c) Fig. 13.8 Dislocation climb. A vacancy in (a) moves into the dislocation core, thereby causing the dislocation to climb to the next higher lattice plane (b, c). Strain energy can be reduced if dislocations a r ea b l et om o v eo u to ft h e i rs l i pp l a n e s .T h i s can be achieved at higher temperatures by a mechanism that involves diffusion of vacancies. Take, for example, a crystal with an edge dis- location and a lattice vacancy (Figure 13.8a). If the vacancy diffuses into the core of the dislocation (Figure 13.8b,c), the dislocation has essentially climbed from the original slip plane to the next higher lattice plane. Assume that a crystal contains two dislocations of opposite sign in slip planes of the same type, but at different levels. These dislocations may move on top of each other by means of slip (Figure 13.9a) and then, through climb, come close together and ultimately join, thereby eliminating each other and reducing the total dislocation density and the strain energy. For dislocations of equal sign, it is energetically preferable for the dislocations to align on top of each other (Figure 13.9b), an organization that can again be achieved by a combination of slip and climb. This mechanism organizes dislocations and creates from an irreg- ular distribution (Figure 13.9c) regular networks known as subgrain boundaries (Figure 13.9d). The dislocations cause a misorientation \u03b8 of the two domains across a subgrain, ranging from 1 \u25e6 to 10\u25e6. This process, in which the dislocation energy is reduced by climb, is called recovery. A typical microstructure with subgrain boundaries in quartz is shown in Figure 13.7d. Microstructures such as those shown in Figure 13.7 are typical of deformation condi- tions. While slip bands and tangles are typical of low-temperature deformation, the signi\ufb01cance of regular networks and loops is that they are associated with thermal activation and diffusion. These features are often observed in naturally de- formed rocks and are indicative of the metamor- phic environment during deformation.

{"text": "Chapter 14 Classi\ufb01cation and names of minerals Minerals, mineral species, and mineral varieties In the \ufb01rst chapter we de\ufb01ned a mineral as anatu- rally occurring solid with well-defined chemistry that is formed by geological and biochemical processes. Note that substances formed by human interven- tion (e.g., products of interaction between seawa- ter and metallurgical slag, or products of coal combustion) are not regarded as minerals. A cer- tain mineral may exist with different morpholo- gies, showing different properties and slight vari- ations in its internal structure. Because of iso- morphism the chemical composition of a min- eral may also \ufb02uctuate. Each particular mineral is therefore a sort of \u2018\u2018individual\u2019\u2019, much as in- dividual plants or animals within a species dif- fer from each other. Biologists introduced the term species to collect individuals with similar characteristics, basing their de\ufb01nition largely on morphological factors. Similarly, the term min- eral species has been introduced to include natu- ral crystals with similar structural and chemical properties. As an illustration, consider how this term can be used with the garnet mineral group. Garnets have a common formula R 1 3R2 2(SiO4)3 (R1 and R 2 representing two different cations). They crystal- lize in cubic symmetry, and their morphology typically displays rhombic dodecahedra, irregu- lar grains, or solid masses. Garnets may be white, green, yellow, brown, raspberry-red, pink or black in color, with considerable variations in density, hardness, and refractive index. This variation can be explained in terms of \ufb02uctuations in chemi- cal composition due to isomorphism (see Chap- ter 6). We plot in Figure 14.1a the compositions of known natural garnets on a triangular dia- gram of three \u2018\u2018end member\u2019\u2019 garnets (alman- dine R 1 = Fe2+,R 2 = Al; pyrope R 1 = Mg, R 2 = Al; and spessartine R 1 = Mn2+,R 2 = Al). Trian- gular (or ternary) diagrams are often used for the representation of mineral composition and in Box 14.1 the construction and mechanics of such diagrams are explained. As Figure 14.1a shows, there is a broad range of compositions between pyrope, almandine, and spessartine. Often only the formulas of the chem- ically pure substances are ascribed to mineral species. For example, almandine is assigned the formula Fe 3Al2(SiO4)3, but in reality its composi- tion ranges between three components and (Fe, Mg, Mn) 3Al2(SiO4)3 would be a more correct for- mula. The order in which the cations are listed in- dicates their relative abundance. The expression (Fe, Mg, Mn) adds up to 1. Some complications of this representation are addressed in Box 14.2. With ionic substitutions, the garnet struc- ture remains more or less unchanged. However, unit cell parameters may increase or decrease, depending on the size of substituting ions, the bond type, and its strength. Figure 14.1b shows how the lattice parameter a and refractive index n correlate with the proportion of Fe 2+, Mg, and Mn in garnets.

{"text": "256 CLASSIFICATION AND NAMES OF MINERALS Box 14.1 How to use ternary diagrams The compositions of minerals with solid solutions that can be described by ma- jor components are often represented in linear (binary solid solution A\u2013B; Figure 14.2a), triangular (ternary solid solution A\u2013B\u2013C; Figure 14.2b) or tetrahedral di- agrams (quaternary solution A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D; Figure 14.2c). The boundaries between the mineral species are generally drawn halfway between the end members in these representations but such boundaries are arbitrary and subject to revision (in all three diagrams, composition X, Y , and Z would be called mineral A). They have nothing to do with the physicochemical properties of the minerals. In most cases the chemical concentrations are expressed by mole percentage (mole%). We focus here on triangular, or ternary, diagrams because there are many examples among minerals and rocks that are composed largely of three components. Let a mineral system be described by A a ,B b, and, Cc , with a, b, and c being fractions or mole% values of components A, B, and C, respectively. The numbers a, b, and c add up to 1 or 100%. A triangle is divided with a grid, composed of three sets of parallel lines (Figure 14.3). Corners labeled A, B, and C represent end member compositions of each component. If a composition is A 50B50, it plots halfway be- tween A and B (point X). Compositions that contain all three components, such as A 70B20C10 plot in the interior of the triangle and we \ufb01nd the point by counting the gridlines (point Y). Only two components are needed to \ufb01nd the point as an intersection of two gridlines. The third component is redundant, assuming that the three components are normalized to 100%.

{"text": "258 CLASSIFICATION AND NAMES OF MINERALS Box 14.2 Simpli\ufb01ed formulas of minerals Many minerals have complicated and variable chemical compositions because of isomorphic substitution of chemical elements in their lattices. That is the reason why the same mineral can have different formulas in handbooks, textbooks, glossaries, and publications. For example, diopside can be described with formulas such as CaMgSi 2O6, Ca(Mg,Fe,Mn)Si2O6, (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe)Si2O6. For sphalerite you may \ufb01nd in the lit- erature ZnS, (Zn, Fe)S, (Zn, Fe, Mn)S and (Zn, Cd)S. The formula of pyrochlore is sometimes (Ca, Na) 2(Nb, Ta)2O6(OH, F) or (Ca, Na, REE, Th, U)Nb2O6(OH, F) depending on the emphasis. None of these expressions is wrong, but let us explain which formulas we will use in this textbook. We will follow two basic rules. 1. We prefer a simple formula and thus use in most cases the formulas of end members. We describe diopside as CaMgSi 2O6 and sphalerite as ZnS, even though these ideal compositions rarely exist in nature. 2. A formula has to be charge balanced. For diopside, cations CaMgSi 2 give a charge of 12+, and the six oxygen atoms a charge of 12 \u2212. For sphalerite the 2+ charge of zinc is balanced by the 2\u2212 charge of sulfur. The two formulas for pyrochlore that we gave above do not satisfy either rule. First, they are too complicated. Second, they are not charge balanced because of the arbitrary substitution Ca 2+ \u21cc Na+. Therefore simpli\ufb01ed formulas are used: CaNaNb2O6OH and CaNaNb 2O6F, corresponding to the compositions of end members. Hollandite is a common mineral in manganese ores. It is frequently described with a formula Ba(Mn 2+,M n4+)8O16 and a substitution Mn 2+ \u21cc Mn4+. Only if we write BaMn 2+Mn4+ 7 O16 are charges balanced, with a \ufb01xed Mn 2+:Mn4+ ratio. Intermediate substitutions are either balanced by anion vacancies or by coupled substitutions. An example for the latter is the feldspar plagioclase with a for- mula (Na +,C a 2+)Si2(Si4+,A l 3+)AlO8. In this case the substitutions Na+ \u21cc Ca2+ and Si 4+ \u21cc Al3+ are rigorously linked and a better formula is (Na+ x Ca2+ (1\u2212x))Si2(Si4+ x Al3+ (1\u2212x) )AlO8, with 0 < x < 1. in sphalerite causes some transformations: vacan- cies arise (3Zn 2+ \u21cc 2In3+ + (vacancies)), the sym- metry changes, and some interatomic distances vary, but all these variations are minor and are within a single mineral species because the max- imum In content in sphalerite does not exceed about 2 weight% (\u2248 2 mole% In 0.67S). Elementary chemical composition The complete number of mineral species with individual mineral names (in the recent in- terpretation of this term) is about 4000. The number changes constantly because many newly discovered minerals have not yet been studied suf\ufb01ciently to be accepted as \u2018\u2018mineral species\u2019\u2019. In addition, several older minerals are being eliminated because they are today considered to represent just a chemical or structural vari- ety of another mineral or are synonymous with older names (e.g., amethyst is a variety of", "page": 281}

The most common minerals are those that contain the most abundant elements (see also Chapter 2). If we order the elements according to their abundance in the earth\u2019s crust, we ob- tain the following sequence (atomic percentage (atomic%) in parentheses): O (53.39), H (17.25), Si (16.11), Al (4.80), Na (1.82), Mg (1.72), Ca (1.41), Fe (1.31), K (1.05), C (0.51), Ti (0.22), Cl (1.10), F (0.07). This sequence generally correlates with the num- ber of minerals that contain these elements, but there are exceptions. For example, many rare el- ements such as arsenic, phosphorus, lead, and copper are found in a large number of minerals (Table 14.1, Figure 14.5). The number of minerals containing a certain element depends on this el- ement\u2019s chemical activity (high activity produces more minerals), its tendency to substitute for other elements (generally isomorphism decreases the probability of an element occurring in many minerals), and the uneven elemental distribution in different rocks. The element hydrogen plays an important role in minerals. Hydrogen is present in more than half of all minerals, and it may occur i nt h ef o r mo fH +,O H \u2212,H 3O+ or H 2O. Pro- tons (i.e., H +) are rarely present, and if present, the proton is always surrounded by a pair of oxygen atoms. An example is diaspore (HAlO 2), whose structure consists of close-packed oxy- gens, with aluminum occupying octahedral in- terstices and H + located between two oxygen atoms. In comparison, the hydroxide ion (OH \u2212) is quite common, examples including sheet sil- icates such as muscovite (KAl 2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2), gibbsite (Al(OH)3), and malachite (Cu 2(CO3)(OH)2). In size, the hydroxide ion is similar to the oxygen atom and substitutes for it. By contrast, H 3O+ is much larger and can substitute for K +. Finally, molecular H2O can exist in a mineral structure at speci\ufb01c atomic positions such as in gypsum (CaSO 4\u00b72H2O). When the mineral is heated, H 2O molecules are released and the structure breaks down. In zeolites and clay minerals, molecular water is located", "page": 282}

Box 14.3 Calculation of mineral formulas from weight percentage oxides The classical methods of gravimetric chemical analysis involve converting each con- stituent to its oxide and presenting each as a weight percentage (weight%) of the total. Even today, when modern, nongravimetric analytical methods are used (e.g., atomic absorption, electron microprobe), it has remained conventional to express the results in terms of oxide percentages. These percentages can be converted to absolute numbers of atoms in a chemical formula, generally normalized to integer numbers of atoms as in corundum (Al 2O3), or in solid solutions such as an intermediate olivine ((Mg0.7Fe0.3)2SiO4), so that the sum of substituting atoms, Mg + Fe is an integer. Generally a simple multiple of formula units occupy a unit cell. Calculation of a chemical formula from weight% oxides is straightforward for stoichiometric compounds and is easily extended to solid solutions. The process becomes more dif\ufb01cult, however, if atomic vacancies are present in such minerals as amphiboles and sheet silicates, if ions have variable oxidation states, or if a mineral contains components that were not analyzed. Also, any chemical analysis contains minor errors, and the sum of components often does not add exactly to 100%. We will \ufb01rst illustrate the procedure for stoichiometric perovskite and then extend it to ilmenite with a solid solution, and a plagioclase feldspar. For more complicated cases consult the literature (e.g., Droop, 1987; Bulakh and Zussman, 1994). Many computer programs have been designed for the calculation of mineral formulas (see, e.g., Rock and Carroll, 1990). In our \ufb01rst example, we wish to calculate the formula of perovskite from the weight% value of oxides (second column in Table 14.2). T o do so, we divide the weight% values of each oxide by its molecular weight (third column) to obtain", "page": 283}
{"text": "CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS 261 molecular proportions (fourth column). After normalizing the resulting proportions to clear fractions (i.e., dividing by 0.736), we obtain the formula 1 CaO + 1 TiO2 = CaTiO3. Another example, the trigonal oxide mineral ilmenite, may contain some sub- stitutions of Mg and Mn for Fe. A typical analysis is given in Table 14.3. Again, we obtain molecular proportions by dividing weight% values by the molecular weight. We then separate the molecular proportions into atomic proportions of cations and oxygens. From crystal chemistry we know that the ideal formula of ilmenite is FeTiO 3. Thus the atomic proportions for the sample analyzed in Table 14.3 can be normalized such that the sum of oxygen atoms is three. We multiply the atomic proportions of cations by 3/2.0199 = 1.485 to obtain the corresponding number of cations (last column). Using the cation proportions in Table 14.2, we can write the formula for this particular ilmenite as (Fe 0.80Mg0.10Mn0.10)Ti1.00O3.00. Our third example is a plagioclase feldspar with an extensive solid solution of Ca, Na, and K. Again, we obtain molecular and atomic proportions from weight% values (Table 14.4). Since an ideal formula of feldspar such as albite is NaAlSi 3O8, we normalize the atomic proportions to eight oxygen atoms (last column) and write the formula as (Ca 0.14 Na0.79 K0.07)(Si2.85 Al1.15)O8. Note that the tetrahedral cations (Si, Al) add up to four, and the large cations (Ca, Na and K) sum approxi- mately to 1. The composition of feldspars is often expressed in percentages of the end members anorthite CaAl 2Si2O8 (An), albite NaAlSi3O8 (Ab), and orthoclase KAlSi3O8 (Or).

We emphasize that all classi\ufb01ca- tions are arbitrary and are a product of the hu- man mind, which seeks to order and simplify. For example, instead of using the chemical composi- tion or crystal structure, one could order miner- als alphabetically or according to their density. Classi\ufb01cations are needed, but keep in mind that they are also limited because nature does not al- ways follow rules. For example, is the evaporite mineral hanksite (KNa 2Cl(CO3)2(SO4)9) a chloride, a carbonate, or a sulfate?

Bulachite is not named after the second author, but after a town in the Black Forest in Germany. Some names indicate the chemical composition of a mineral (e.g., calcite for calcium, sodalite for sodium). Certain mineral names are linked to properties (e.g., orthoclase has right (or- thogonal) angles between cleavages, albite comes from the Latin word alba, meaning \u2018\u2018white\u2019\u2019), or the mode of mineral\u2019s occurrence ( monazite for the tendency of this mineral to form isolated crystals).

Such ability is developed largely through practice and experience, involving repeated observations of characteristic simple physical properties. Some of these observations can be made directly, with the naked eye. However, because many of the mineral grains in rocks are exceedingly small, commonly less than 1 mm in diameter, a high-quality hand lens (magni\ufb01cation 5\u00d7 or 10\u00d7) is an indispens- able tool for routine \ufb01eld and laboratory obser- vations. Most hand specimen identi\ufb01cation is based only upon the state of aggregation and on sim- ple physical properties that can be determined by inspection or by some rapid and easily per- formed nondestructive tests. Many common min- erals can be identi\ufb01ed reasonably accurately in this fashion, even in the \ufb01eld. Note, however, that most of these properties are qualitative descrip- tions and often vary within a mineral species. In other cases, two distinct minerals may have very similar crystals and physical properties (e.g., proustite--pyrargyrite, quartz--phenakite), and can be told apart only after a detailed examination of their optical characteristics, chemical compo- sition or X-ray diffraction patterns. Many of the properties used for identi\ufb01cation purposes have been introduced in earlier chap- ters. Here we review those that are most relevant for mineral identi\ufb01cation. State of aggregation (including crystallographic form and habit) Some crystals, particularly those that have grown to large size in veins or cavities in otherwise \ufb01ner grained rocks, have characteristic shapes and di- mensions that re\ufb02ect the processes by which they have been deposited. Others occur in amorphous- looking masses with characteristic surface tex- tures. Highly subjective and somewhat fanciful terms are used to describe the state of aggrega- tion of mineral bodies and the visible shapes of individual crystals. Most minerals occur as small, uniformly sized grains, making up the polycrystalline aggregates we call rocks. With a hand lens the geologist can generally determine the approximate shapes and sizes of such grains and from these make tentative or \ufb01rm identi\ufb01cations of the minerals present. Of particular help in identi\ufb01cation are any crystal faces that may be developed on the grains. Terms used to describe the degree of develop- ment of faces are: r Euhedral: Grains fully enclosed by recognizable crystal faces. r Subhedral: Grains partly enclosed by recognizable crystal faces. r Anhedral:G r a i n sw i t hn ov i s i b l ec r y s t a lf a c e s .", "page": 289}
{"text": "COLOR, STREAK, AND LUSTER 267 Careful study of the angles between crystal faces on euhedral and subhedral grains can be a guide to the symmetry of the crystals present and thus to their identity. Of equal importance in this respect are the relative dimensions of grains, especially those showing crystal faces (see Figure 5.2). Three main types of morphol- ogy for mineral grains can be recognized, as follows: 1. Granular or equant:G r a i n sa r em o r eo r less equidimensional or spheroidal. This shape is common in crystals of the isometric system such as garnet, which commonly crystallizes as do- decahedra. However, anhedral equant grains may crystallize in any system. Quartz, for example, is usually anhedral and equant in quartz-bearing rocks such as granite, quartzite or sandstone, although its crystal symmetry is trigonal. In vesicles, quartz has the characteristic prismatic- rhombohedral morphology. 2. Tabular or platy:C r y s t a l sh a v et w o ,m o r e or less equal dimensions and one signi\ufb01cantly shorter dimension. This shape is most typi- cal of crystals with a sheet-like arrangements of atoms. Mica and chlorite are good exam- ples of rock-forming minerals that commonly adopt this habit, generally in metamorphic rocks, where a preferred orientation of the grains con- tributes towards the texture called slaty cleav- age or schistosity (also known as foliation). Graphite and molybdenite are examples of ore minerals with similar structures and habits. The tabular habit is rarely found in cubic crys- tals, but it can arise in most other crystal systems. 3. Prismatic, acicular,o rfibrous:C r y s t a l sa r e more or less rod shaped, with one long dimen- sion and two roughly equal shorter dimensions. This habit is typical of crystals with one princi- pal axis of symmetry (3-, 4-, or 6-fold) bounded by prisms, sets of identical crystal faces paral- lel to the long dimension of the grain. Trig- onal and hexagonal crystals typically have 3, 6, or 12 faces, while tetragonal crystals typi- cally have 4 or 8 faces. However, under speci\ufb01c growth conditions, such crystals become elon- gated perpendicular to the principal axis of sym- metry. Quartz, for example, when growing into a cavity, will often form almost perfect hexag- onal (six-sided) prisms; in other cases, it might form spherulites consisting of \ufb01bers parallel to [110] (this variety is called chalcedony). However, triclinic, monoclinic, and orthorhombic crystals also occur with prismatic habits. An example can be seen in the typically prismatic crystals of monoclinic amphiboles such as hornblende and glaucophane. Color, streak, and luster The way in which an incident light beam inter- acts with a mineral is expressed by three differ- ent properties: 1. Color: The color of a mineral as directly ob- served can be so characteristic as to be an impor- tant aid in identi\ufb01cation, but it can also be mis- leading. Most minerals, even the rock-forming sil- icates in which isomorphous series are present, can show", "page": 290}
{"text": "a bewildering variety of colors. In gen- eral, color by itself is insuf\ufb01cient to permit identi- \ufb01cation, but it can be useful when taken together with other properties. 2. Streak: Many minerals show a characteristic color when reduced to a \ufb01ne powder, regardless of the color they show in a bulk specimen. An example is hematite, which can range from red to metallic gray in hand specimens but always produces a dark red-brown powder on grinding. This property is called streak because the simplest way to produce a \ufb01ne powder from most miner- als is to scratch a sharp edge of a specimen across a rough ceramic plate (a streak plate), leaving a trail of dust-like powder. A colorless mineral, or one that is harder than the streak plate, scratches the plate to leave a trail of white powder. Most rock-forming silicates are harder than a streak plate, and the streak is of little help in their identi\ufb01cation. Streak is most useful and diagnos- tic in the study of opaque ore minerals (e.g., sul- \ufb01des and oxides), particularly those with metallic or submetallic luster (see below). Some of these ore minerals have a metallic or shining streak, whereas others have a nonmetallic streak. Follow- ing is a list of some common opaque minerals", "page": 290}

Luster: The term luster is used to describe the character of the light re\ufb02ected from the sur- face of a mineral and depends on the refractive index. Terms in common use refer the luster of a mineral to that of some common material (e.g., metallic luster, waxy luster, earthy luster, and so on). The main division is into metallic and non- metallic and the latter can have many different expressions. The luster of some minerals is as follows: Metallic: silver, mercury (liquid), bismuth, galena, molybdenite, stibnite, chal- cocite, graphite, covellite, bornite, copper, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, marcasite, gold. Submetallic (semi-metallic): hematite, ilmenite, rutile, pyrolusite, manganite, goethite, wol- framite, magnetite. Adamantine (diamond-like): cassiterite, zircon, sphalerite, diamond, scheelite, realgar, cinnabar, cuprite, wulfenite. Resinous (oily, greasy, waxy): apatite, nepheline, halite, gypsum, serpentine, talc, sulfur, or- piment, sodalite, chalcedony. Vitreous (glassy): quartz, opal, amphibole, pyroxene, olivine, feldspar, barite, ce- lestite, anhydrite, beryl, garnet, tourmaline, dolomite, calcite, \ufb02uorite, spinel, cordierite, kyanite, epidote, apatite, topaz. Many other rock-forming minerals are in this group. Earthy: graphite, goethite, limonite, clay min- erals, anglesite, magnesite, hematite, chlo- rite. Minerals with a perfect cleavage may exhibit a conspicuous pearly luster, which is usually seen only on the surface of cleavage. Note that some minerals can occur with a variety of lusters or show different luster on crystal faces and broken surfaces. Mechanical properties With little more equipment than a hammer and a pocket knife, a geologist can examine some of the mechanical properties of a mineral. The most obvious and easily determined of these are de- scribed below. Hardness Hardness is de\ufb01ned loosely as resistance to inden- tation or abrasion. Quantitative tests for hard- ness can be made under a microscope using a diamond indenter and are an important part of the mineralogy of opaque ore minerals. The av- erage geologist studies merely relative hardness, expressed by the resistance offered by a smooth surface of a mineral to scratching by a sharp edge on a material of known hardness. Around 1800 the German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs de- vised a relative scale that compares the hardness of some standard minerals (Table 15.1) and this scale is still used universally.", "page": 291}

The Mohs\u2019 scale is nonlinear as compared with an absolute scale such as the Vicker\u2019s indentation hardness (Figure 15.1), but each mineral on the Mohs\u2019 scale will scratch minerals with a lower number and can be scratched by minerals with a higher number. For example, most rock-forming silicates are 6 or harder on the Mohs\u2019 scale, and thus will scratch minerals of hardness 5 or less. The position of an unknown mineral on the scale can be established by such scratching tests. Sets of these minerals (excluding diamond) are com- mercially available at modest cost, but, in prac- tice, a rough determination of hardness is gener- ally made using the simpler scale below: Material Hardness Thumbnail about 2 Copper penny 3 to 4 Blade of pocket knife, window glass 5 to 6 Quartz or streak plate 6 to 7 When testing the hardness of a mineral, the following practices should be observed: r First, examine the surface to be scratched with a hand lens before the test to detect the presence of old scratches. r After the test, brush away any powder and use the hand lens on both surfaces to con\ufb01rm the presence of scratch and on which surface it lies. r Make certain that the material is really scratched and not just granulated on pre-existing open fractures or cleavage surfaces (see below). After the test, a few important points should be borne in mind when interpreting the results: r Remember that minerals of similar hardness can simultaneously scratch each other. r A crystal may be slightly harder on one face than on another, and harder in one direction than in another on the same face. Cleavage and fracture Most minerals break when struck sharply with a hammer or a knife blade, and the nature of the surface so produced can be a diagnostic property. Two types of failure surface are recognized: 1. Cleavage: Some crystals break in one (Fig- ure 15.2a) or more smooth plane surfaces (Fig- ure 15.2b--e) whose orientation is determined by the regular atomic structure of the crystal. Such surfaces, called cleavages, occur along planes of weak atomic cohesion, and they re\ufb02ect the", "page": 292}

The 3-fold symmetry axis is vertical. internal symmetry of the crystal structure in much the same way as do crystal faces. Although cleavage surfaces super\ufb01cially resemble crystal faces, they can be generally distinguished by the fact that they occur in parallel families spaced on the atomic scale. The crystal can be broken at any point along a cleavage plane, whereas most crystals do not necessarily break in the direction of a crystal face. Also, when observed through a hand lens, most cleavages display a \u2018\u2018stepped\u2019\u2019 surface where the actual plane of breakage shifts from one level to another in the crystal (Figure 15.2c,e). If a mineral has a single excellent cleav- age (graphite, molybdenite, and mica are exam- ples), \ufb02akes are produced (Figure 15.2a). If it has two excellent cleavages, the mineral breaks into \ufb01bers (sillimanite and wollastonite are examples, Figure 15.2b). Many minerals cleave in more than one plane. If the cleavages are of the same kind of form (i.e., they are related by symmetry operations of the crystal structure), the angles between them can be a guide to the symmetry and should be esti- mated. For example, halite has cleavage planes parallel to the cube faces {100} at right angles (Figure 15.2c) and \ufb02uorite has an octahedral cleav- age (Figure 15.2d). Calcite has a cleavage given by the Miller--Bravais indices {10\u00af14}, consisting of three identical planes inclined at about 70 \u25e6 to one another, symmetrically arranged about the 3-fold rotation--inversion axis of the crystal (Fig- ure 15.2e, Figure 15.3). This pattern can be seen clearly on a cleavage rhomb of Iceland spar (a glass-clear variety of calcite). Albite, on the other hand, has two cleavage planes, but they belong to two different forms, (001) and (010), and are un- related by symmetry operations. For this reason the two albite cleavages are not identical, with one being more highly developed than the other and they are at a slightly oblique angle. Cleavage surfaces should not be confused with other planar surfaces of breakage found on some crystals, called partings. These are discretely spaced surfaces separating parts of a crystal in which the structure differs in orientation (e.g., twin-lamellae), and surfaces saturated with in- clusions (e.g., exsolution lamellae or \ufb02uid inclu- sions) or weakened by stress (e.g., in metamor- phic quartz). The latter types of surface are not always developed on a given mineral and, unlike cleavage surfaces, are not pervasive on the atomic scale. 2. Fracture: Many mineral crystals (e.g., quartz) show only poorly de\ufb01ned cleavage or none at all. When such crystals are struck they break on generally irregularly oriented", "page": 293}

Irregular fracture is typical of minerals without cleavage such as apatite. A special type is con- choidal fracture, with smooth curved surfaces as in quartz and opal. Stepped fracture occurs in minerals with several cleavages, for example halite, galena, and feldspars. Splintery fracture is observed in \ufb01brous minerals such as actinolite and anthophyllite.

The specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a body and the weight of an equal volume of water, a dimensionless quan- tity. For practical purposes, density and speci\ufb01c gravity can be taken as numerically equal. Min- eral specimens with widely different densities and similar sizes can be distinguished easily by \u2018\u2018heft\u2019\u2019, i.e., by the feeling of weight in a speci- men bounced lightly in the hand. Try to gauge relative heft with specimens of known density and acquire a feeling for minerals with low (1.5-- 2.5 g/cm 3), intermediate (2.5--3.0 g/cm3), and high (above 3.0 g/cm 3) densities (Table 8.3). As may be expected, the density is high for close-packed structures as in metals, sul\ufb01des and oxides, and low for open polyhedral structures as in borates, sulfates, carbonates, and silicates. Other properties Certain minerals have obvious and diagnostic properties not covered in the above discussion. Examples are: Feel: Talc and serpentine feel slippery or \u2018\u2018soapy\u2019\u2019. Taste: Water-soluble minerals such as halite have unmistakable tastes when touched lightly on the tongue. Odor: Some freshly broken or lightly heated minerals emit characteristic odors. This property is especially true of some sulfur- and arsenic-bearing minerals. Magnetic properties: A few minerals -- notably magnetite, and some varieties of ilmenite and pyrrhotite -- are strongly magnetic. This property can be tested with a hand magnet. Fluorescence: In ultraviolet light many miner- als \ufb02uoresce visibly with characteristic col- ors (see the discussion in Chapter 11 and also Table 11.2). Note that some minerals continue to emit light after the exposure to ultraviolet rays; this property is called phos- phorescence. Radioactivity: Minerals can be weakly or strongly radioactive. Radioactivity can be measured with a Geiger counter. Change of color: Some minerals (e.g., colored", "page": 294}
{"text": "varieties of quartz and sodalite) may tem- porarily or permanently change their color when exposed to radiation, i.e., heat, X-rays, photons, etc. Tarnish: Some opaque minerals (such as sul- \ufb01des) react with atmospheric moisture, oxy- gen, and carbon dioxide to become coated with a thin \ufb01lm of brightly colored sec- ondary minerals (e.g., bornite). Color effects associated with microstructures: Sev- eral of these effects associated with spe- ci\ufb01c mineral types have been discussed in Chapter 11.

Many rocks -- particularly those formed by igneous and metamorphic processes, including primary ore deposits -- are thought to be more or less in chemical equilibrium at the time of formation, and thus coexisting minerals or associations of minerals are in de\ufb01nite chemi- cal relation to one another. Sometimes the iden- tity of an unknown mineral can be closely de- termined by noting which other minerals occur with it. Whenever you examine a specimen, try to determine all the minerals present and \ufb01nd the origin of the assemblage. For example, galena is often associated with sphalerite, quartz, and cal- cite in hydrothermal veins. Some directions for practical mineral identi\ufb01cation Developing one\u2019s skills in identifying minerals in hand specimens can be learned only by conscien- tious practice and careful observation. The more time you spend examining the minerals and read- ing about them in reference books or textbooks, the easier it will be for you to identify them when you encounter them in the \ufb01eld, laboratory, or on a collector\u2019s shelf. Many minerals can be recognized by particu- lar combinations of easily observed or measured physical properties, and it is wise to follow some standard procedures. The most useful and diagnostic of these properties are color, luster, streak, hardness, density (or speci\ufb01c gravity), fracture/cleavage, state of aggregation (including crystallographic forms, if present), and associa- tion (other minerals present), as described above. It is useful to acquaint yourself with a mineral set in a reference collection for practicing identi- \ufb01cation. Study a mineral, read about its principal properties in the text, and try to recognize these properties in reference specimens. You may then try to improve your skills by diagnosing unknown minerals. In addition, try to memorize the chem- ical formulas of the more common minerals, or at least remember which elements are present. Through keen observation and much experience and training, you will develop your visual mem- ory. Such practice will also help you to \ufb01nd your own methods of mineral identi\ufb01cation. In routine identi\ufb01cation, the \ufb01rst step is usu- ally to classify a mineral according to luster into two major groups, metallic and nonmetallic (Fig- ure 15.4, and determinative tables in Appendix 1). The next step is to classify minerals in each of these main groups according", "page": 295}

In mineralogy, gen- esis refers to both primary crystallization and the subsequent history of minerals, which may include structural transitions, changes in tex- ture (e.g., grain coarsening), exsolution processes and chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation). Both \u2018\u2018syngenetic\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018epigenetic\u2019\u2019 aspects depend on the geological environment and are governed by physical and chemical laws. Genetic mineralogy is one of the most in- teresting branches of mineralogy and relates directly to petrology, economic geology, physics (especially thermodynamics), and chemistry. Ul- timately a mineral and its properties and com- position cannot be understood in isolation from its environment. Whereas some processes are rel- atively simple and have been studied in much detail (e.g., the crystallization of clinopyroxene phenocrysts from a ma\ufb01c magma), others are still very puzzling and lack a quantitative physical explanation (e.g., the formation of dolomite in sedimentary rocks, or the nucleation and growth patterns of minerals in metamorphic rocks). The objects and purposes of genetic mineral- ogy are very diverse. To date, various directions of research have been pursued, including primar- ily: (1) empirical investigation of the principles that control mineral formation in the geological environment; (2) quantitative geothermometric, geobarometric, and chemical studies of mineral- forming systems; and (3) experimental modeling of crystal growth in the laboratory. A mineral deposit is a geological body that forms under speci\ufb01c conditions and contains minerals or mineral assemblages characteristic of that particular type of mineral deposit. Within the deposit, a mineral may be scattered through- out different rocks and ores, or occur indepen- dently as segregations, lenses, strata, veinlets and veins of various shape. There are deposits that in- clude numerous rock units and show a fascinat- ing diversity of minerals (e.g., skarns or layered ma\ufb01c intrusions), and others (e.g., rock-salt for- mations) that consist of a single rock type with very little variation in mineralogy. Mineral de- posits are commercially exploited as the natural source of metals and useful materials. Mineral-forming environments In a physical and chemical sense, mineral nucle- ation and crystal growth may occur in any of several different systems. These systems include aqueous solution, gas, a mixture of gas and liq- uid, colloidal solution, magma (mainly the sub- ject of igneous petrology), and solid or solid with solution as \ufb01lms along grain boundaries (the sub- ject of metamorphic petrology). Aqueous solutions Aqueous solutions occur due to processes oper- ating in the interior of the earth (endogenic) or", "page": 299}

The former type of solution is classi\ufb01ed as hydrothermal, and the latter as surface (vadose) or brines. There are several sources of water for the hydrothermal solutions. First, crystallizing magma chambers release volatile components that mi- grate to the country rocks and form liquid miner- alized aqueous solutions. Second, the reactions of dehydration and decarbonation in the deeper parts of the crust produce water and carbon dioxide. Many types of sedimentary rock, such as clays and siliceous limestones, undergo dehy- dration and decarbonation processes during re- gional metamorphism. Finally, controversial pro- cesses of mantle degassing may be a source of water. It has been proposed that some hydrocar- bons could escape from the earth\u2019s mantle, and that their oxidation produces water and carbon dioxide when they rise to the crustal levels. Such processes may be described by the reaction: CH4 + 2O2 \u2192 2H2O + CO2 The reactions described above usually produce energy that heats the \ufb02uids as well as the country rocks. Not all water sources for hydrothermal so- lutions lie beneath the earth\u2019s surface. Another source is surface (meteoric) water. Investigations have shown that surface water can migrate to a depth of over 500 m, heating up and dissolving mineral components and exchanging atoms and ions with adjacent rocks. Another source is sea- water circulated through \ufb01ssures in the oceanic crust and responsible for much of the hydrother- mal activity at mid-oceanic ridges, seamounts and some back-arc basins. As the solutions move along their pathways, some components are removed from adjacent rocks while others are added indirectly from magmatic sources. In hydrothermal solutions, components are transferred predominantly as aqueous complexes (Table 16.1). If the solution is basic (high pH) quartz is easily dissolved, trans- ported, and precipitated as veins where pressure and temperature are lower. The composition of the hydrothermal solution is often derived from the rock through which the solution \ufb02ows and, in the case of magmatic hydrothermal solutions, from the type of magma that gave rise to the \ufb02uids initially. Quartz is the most important hy- drothermal mineral. Calcite veins form where metamorphic solutions acquired a large partial pressure of CO 2 from mineral reactions, from dis- solution of carbonaceous rocks, or from mantle sources. There are many mineral deposits that crystallized from hydrothermal solutions. Exam- ples are accumulations of various sul\ufb01de ores containing pyrite (FeS 2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), sphalerite (ZnS), and galena", "page": 300}

Also, there are lacustrine, oceanic, and lagoon waters that can produce beds of evaporite minerals, such as halite, gypsum, and some varieties of limestone. Waters in different environments have a dis- tinct isotopic signature, and hydrogen and oxy- gen isotopes incorporated into minerals can be used to trace the origin of a particular water sample. Figure 16.1 illustrates deviations \u03b4 of the ratios of heavier and lighter isotopes of water ( 18O:16Oa n d2D:1H) in various environments from that of present-day seawater (also referred to as \u2018\u2018standard mean ocean water\u201d or SMOW), i.e., \u03b4 18O = [(18O/16Osample)/(18O/16OSMOW) \u2212 1] \u00d7 1000. A negative value indicates that isotopes are lighter than seawater and a positive value indicates that they are heavier. When H 2Oe v a p o r a t e sf r o ms e a - water, the vapor is enriched with light isotopes that require less energy to vaporize than do the heavier isotopes. Also, during condensation and rainfall, heavier isotopes are concentrated in the rain, and, with increasing distance from the ocean, the \u03b4 values become smaller and smaller. This is indicated by the \u2018\u2018Meteoric water\u2019\u2019 line in Figure 16.1. Metamorphic and magmatic wa- ters are considerably heavier than meteoric wa- ter. Waters in sedimentary basins are intermedi- ate. This signature is inherited by minerals that contain water, for example sheet silicates, and one can determine whether a kaolinite, for ex- ample, was formed by surface weathering or by alteration through magmatic solutions. The iso- tope ratios in minerals also provide information about temperatures during crystallization. Gas Gas is a relatively rare crystallization environ- ment, but some minerals are known to pre- cipitate under such conditions. For example, hematite (Fe 2O3), salammoniac (NH 4Cl), realgar (AsS), and native sulfur may crystallize from vol- canic gases (Figure 16.2). Also, ice crystals fre- quently grow from vapor, producing dendritic snow\ufb02ake patterns (Figure 5.11). Fluid Most geological processes are con\ufb01ned to the pressure--temperature range within which water occurs as a liquid phase or supercritical \ufb02uid, the latter being neither gas nor liquid. In many cases, \ufb02uid mixtures of CO 2 and H 2O are ac- tive in mineral-forming processes, especially dur- ing the formation of skarns and metamorphism of limestone under high pressure and tempera- ture conditions. Similar \ufb02uids cause alteration of dunites and peridotites, producing amphi- boles, serpentine, or talc, in association with cal- cite, magnesite, or dolomite.

Colloidal solutions Colloidal solutions are a typical mineral-forming environment in ocean \ufb02oor silts rich in clay min- erals, aluminum, iron, and manganese hydrox- ides. There are not many cases where minerals obviously crystallized from colloidal systems in hot aqueous solutions. An example is silica gel formation in thermal springs in areas of recent volcanic activity and subsequent precipitation of amorphous opal from the gels, as in Yellowstone National Park, USA (Figure 16.4). Magma Magma is not a simple melt such as melts of pure substances like water (from ice) or melted sugar (from crystalline sugar), where the liquid com- position corresponds completely to that of the crystals. It is a mixture and even the composi- tions of granites and many other plutonic rocks do not accurately correspond to those of their parental magmas, for reasons that will be ex- p l a i n e dl a t e r .Am a g m ah a st h ep r o p e r t i e so fal i q - uid as well as of a solution.

The anion groups are locally organized into clusters, but without long-range atomic order, as in a crystal struc- ture. Silicate melts contain primarily (Si, Al)O 4 tetrahedra, sometimes isolated, but more often linked into irregular groups (Figure 16.5). There are ion groups such as Si 2O6\u2212 7 , n(SiO3)2n\u2212,S i6O12\u2212 18 , n(Si4O11)6n\u2212, MgO 10\u2212 6 ,C a O10\u2212 6 ,A l O5\u2212 4 , and SiO 4\u2212 4 . They represent nuclei and building blocks for subsequent crystallization of silicates. The rela- tive proportion of tetrahedra connected into indi- vidual building blocks increases with increasing silica content. Silicic magmas are signi\ufb01cantly more polymerized than their ma\ufb01c counterparts. Magmas also contain large cations such as K + and Na+. Solid systems Solid systems can be either amorphous or crystalline. An example of the former is vol- canic glass, which is not very stable and tends to devitrify with time. In crystalline systems three types of process can be distinguished. First there are polymorphic transitions (e.g., di- amond to graphite, high quartz to low quartz, aragonite to calcite), which do not involve a change in chemical composition of the mineral.

Examples are pseudo- morphs, such as limonite replacing pyrite. A third type comprises replacement processes, such as the growth of so-called porphyroblasts in meta- morphic rocks, like garnet growing in a gneiss and replacing most of the pre-existing minerals and incorporates a few as inclusions (Figure 16.6, see also Figure 5.23). These transformations are generally associated with a thin molecular \ufb01lm of water along grain boundaries that transports elements to crystallization sites. Types of mineral crystallization Why do minerals form? This is a question with more than one answer. The main reason for crystallization of new minerals from pre-existing phases is that they are more stable than the melts, or solutions, or pre-existing minerals. Crys- tallization occurs during undercooling of liquids, gases, and supersaturation of solutions associ- ated with changes in pressure, temperature, or the concentration of chemical components. We will discuss each of these conditions in more de- tail in Chapter 17. We can classify crystallization based on the volume that the new crystal occupies and dis- tinguish between free space crystallization , metaso- matism, and recrystallization. Some crystals grow freely in a gas, a melt or a solution. Examples are sulfur growing in volcanic gas, porphyritic feldspars growing in a magma, and amethyst growing in a hydrothermal solution. These crys- tals usually display euhedral habits. Metasomatism is a powerful geological pro- cess that leads to the formation of composition- ally diverse ores and rocks, but many aspects of this process are still unclear. Metasomatism is de\ufb01ned as a process of simultaneous capil- lary dissolution and crystallization, by which a new mineral completely or partially replaces an initial mineral, often changing the chemi- cal composition (e.g., Lindgren, 1933). Metaso- matic substitutions proceed not only through capillary and intragranular \ufb01lm solutions, but also through lattice diffusion. Examples of meta- somatic growth are pseudomorphs and poikilo- blasts, growing in a solid granular pegmatite. An example of a metasomatic rock is greisen,a quartz--mica aggregate that forms when granite is subjected to hydrothermal solutions: 3K(AlSi3O8)+2H+\u2192KAl2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2 +6SiO2 +2K+ Microcline Muscovite Quartz Simultaneously with this reaction, greisens are supplied with tin, which crystallizes in the form of the oxide mineral cassiterite (SnO 2), thus cre- ating an important ore for tin. Recrystallization implies that new crystals re- place those formed earlier. This process may be accompanied by an increase or a decrease in grain size, and it may or may not involve compositional changes. (As a rule, recrystal- lized minerals have fewer chemical impurities.) Recrystallization proceeds in solid state and is driven either by the chemical free energy or by deformation defects in the crystal structure.", "page": 303}

The growth stages are shown sequentially, moving from left to right and top to bottom. Initially, a nucleus grows in a schist with foliation. The garnet incorporates some minerals such as biotite, and as the schist is deformed the garnet rotates progressively and continues to grow. The incorporated schistosity can be used to infer the deformation process and the sense of shear. After deformation has ceased, the garnet continues to grow, replacing the schist. Diagenesis and metamorphism involve recrystal- lization and polymorphic transformations, the former at very low temperature and the latter at higher temperature. The usage of the term \u2018\u2018re- crystallization\u2019\u2019 is different in materials science. There it is restricted to the replacement of de- formed grains by undeformed new grains of the same type. Types of mineral deposit Minerals form virtually at every step in the ge- ological rock cycle, both by internal and ex- ternal processes (Figure 16.7). Feldspars crystal- lize in slowly cooling plutonic magma or in the groundmass of a rapidly quenched volcanic rock. When exposed on the surface, the feldspars are no longer stable and alter during weathering to clay minerals. In evaporite lakes, halite and gypsum precipitate from saturated aqueous solu- tions. Solutions rich in carbonate and silica form calcite and quartz, which cement sand grains to sandstone. During recycling of sedimentary rocks, clay minerals transform to mica at higher pressure and temperature. At greater depth and in contact with a magma, limestone undergoes metamorphic reactions that produce such min- erals as olivine and tremolite. Depending on the environment, minerals may form continuously or discontinuously, and a single mineral may dominate or several miner- als may be present. The boundaries of a mineral deposit mark occurrence limits of a characteris- tic mineral (or, in the case of economic mineral deposits, a desirable concentration level of some useful component). Several classi\ufb01cation princi- ples have been suggested for mineral deposits based on their genesis, mineral type, morphol- ogy of mineral bodies, mineralization scale, eco- nomic factors, and whether the processes involve an u m b e ro fs t a g e so ras i n g l es t a g e .T h em o s t useful classi\ufb01cations seem to be those that apply the genetic principles. We apply a simpli\ufb01ed genetic scheme for the major mineral deposits, as given in Table 16.2. A \ufb01rst division is into deposits formed by endogenic (i.e., internal) and exogenic (i.e., external) pro- cesses. Then we distinguish between magmatic and metamorphic deposits. Magmatic deposits include all those that are related directly to the cooling and crystallization of magmas (igneous deposits), or to activity of postmagmatic \ufb02uids and gases (hydrothermal deposits). Exogenic ge- ological processes form sedimentary mineral de- posits and deposits in weathering zones. There are also intermediate types such as the metal- bearing benthic muds of the Red Sea.

It turns out that some min- eral groups lend themselves well to illustrating certain types of mineral deposit. Thus speci\ufb01c genetic processes will be discussed in conjunc- tion with the relevant mineral or group of miner- als in the chapters to follow (Table 16.2). However, it should be remembered that no genetic process is exclusive to a particular mineral group -- there are many exceptions and overlaps. Multistage processes, generations, and parageneses The formation of any mineral deposit is a long- term multistage process. Minerals crystallize in a certain order that re\ufb02ects changes in pres- sure, temperature, and chemical composition of the crystallization environment. Depending on the local geological conditions, and particularly on global processes related to plate tectonics, mantle plumes and mantle convection, these changes may happen slowly, abruptly, or rhyth- mically. A mineral can crystallize over a single time interval, or its growth may be interrupted by periods of recess, dissolution, and precipitation of other minerals. Assemblages of crystals and grains of the same mineral that formed at dif- ferent times are called generations, as illustrated for celestite in Figure 16.8. Feldspar phenocrysts in a volcanic rock are a \ufb01rst generation, while \ufb01ne-grained feldspar in the groundmass is a sec- ond generation. The grains and crystals of the same mineral belonging to different generations may differ in morphology, size, composition, and properties. Also, they will most likely have dif- ferent relationships with coexisting minerals. An assemblage of minerals that crystallizes nearly contemporaneously, and in similar physical and", "page": 305}

The investigation of mineral parageneses allows petrologists to deduce physical and chemical conditions of their formation. This branch of mineralogy was developed largely by P. Eskola, V.M. Goldschmidt, D.S. Korzhinskii, J.B. Thompson, and F.J. Turner. Crystal growth Growth forms (see Chapter 5) are indicators of a mineral\u2019s genesis, but bear in mind that growth effects and crystal morphology are very diverse and not systematized, mainly because they are not well understood. In many cases crystals have a zoned internal structure that is a valuable source of genetic information. For example, oscillatory zoning in igneous plagioclase marks a pulsating change of crystallization conditions (Plate 3e). Multicolored tourmaline from Mada- gascar and Brazil pegmatites (Plate 5c) consists of alternating pink, lilac, green, colorless, and black zones. One may easily \ufb01nd at least a few dozen different zones within one 5 cm thick tourmaline crystal; each of these zones corresponds to changes in the contents of iron, manganese, and other elements. From observations on zoning we can infer details about the growth rates of various faces (see Chapter 5). The absolute growth rates of natural crystals have been measured in only a few cases. Estimates for the solidi\ufb01cation of a deep-seated granitic magma range from 10 mil- lion to 30 million years. It is not clear, however, what may have been the crystallization span of an individual feldspar or quartz crystal in that magma. Growth of garnet during regional metamorphism may last for 500 000 to 1 million years, and radiometric dating has established that the growth of tourmaline in pegmatites may take as long as 10 million years more. We know that different alkaline rocks within the Kovdor complex in Russia crystallized over a period of 30 million years. But how long or how short was the crystallization of phlogopite, for example, whose crystals sometimes reach 2.5 m across? We have to consider that the growth of natural crystals in rocks is not a continuous process but may occur in discrete episodes, repeating many times. More is known about growth velocities in surface environments, such as lava \ufb02ows and", "page": 306}

Table 16.3 lists extrapolated times that would be required for a crystal to grow to 1 cm in size in these environments. Typomorphism of minerals When minerals crystallize, their chemical com- position, crystal morphology, and properties are related to the environment in which they nucle- ate and grow, and to the physical and chemical conditions of crystallization. These factors dic- tate whether a mineral can occur in a particu- lar deposit. They also control the chemical com- position of minerals, their crystal morphology, and properties. Some minerals display this rela- tionship in a very conspicuous way, and F. Becke (1903) described these examples as typomorphic minerals. For example, systematic changes in the mor- phology of quartz crystals from \ufb01ssures in the Swiss Alps are related to temperature and pres- sure conditions, as well as the composition of \ufb02uids from which these crystals grew (Figure 16.9). These conditions were inferred mainly from a detailed study of \ufb02uid inclusions in quartz. Typical quartz morphologies are illustrated in Figure 16.10. A doubly terminated type with prism {10\u00af10} and steep rhombohedra {30\u00af31} and {03\u00af31} (Figure 16.10a) is typical of the northern low temperature (200 \u25e6C) diagenetic zone (see Figure 16.9). Here, the \ufb02uid was rich in heavy hy- drocarbons released from sedimentary rocks dur- ing their diagenesis. At slightly higher tempera- ture the hydrocarbons transformed to methane (CH 4) and in this gas-rich hydrothermal solution edge-growth with skeletal crystals and frequent scepter overgrowths occurred (Figure 16.10b). Such forms resulted from rapid crystallization when gas was released from the solution dur- ing pressure drops. Further south, the classi- cal symmetric prismatic-rhombohedral quartz, with dominant {10\u00af11} and subordinate {01\u00af11}, is observed (Figure 16.10c). This morphology cor- responds to a fairly pure solution of water, tem- perature of 350 \u25e6C and pressure of 400 MPa. At higher temperatures (450 \u25e6C) and low \ufb02uid pres- sures (100 MPa), in the rapidly uplifting and eroding southern part, where CO 2 was the ma- jor gas phase, quartz attained a stepped mor- phology known as the \u2018\u2018Tessin habit\u2019\u2019 incorporat- ing the prism and steep rhombohedra {30\u00af3\u00af1} and {03\u00af3\u00af1}.

Cassiterite changes from a barrel-shaped isometric habit, over a prismatic-columnar habit to an acicular habit. The border of the economical ores is outlined in black and this zone coincides with columnar cassiterite habit (after Evzikova, 1984). Morphological features of a mineral can fre- quently be used as a prospecting criterion and this has been extensively employed in Russia. For example, in cassiterite (SnO 2) crystals from a hydrothermal tin deposit in eastern Siberia, the crystal habit changes from isometric and barrel-shaped (at depth), to columnar/prismatic in the central part, to acicular near the sur- face (Figure 16.11). During the movement of ore- forming solutions from depth to the surface the crystals precipitate at various temperatures and this is expressed in the habit. In the central part of the vein system crystals display a columnar habit and precipitation is most extensive. Such a regular relationship between morphology and occurrence can be of practical importance in an- swering such questions as: How deeply is a vein eroded? (If a vein con- tains many equiaxed crystals, it is deeply eroded.) How far does a vein extend? (The more slowly cassiterite changes its habit, the farther the vein extends.)

{"text": "Chapter 17 Stability of minerals. Principles of thermodynamics Introduction Minerals form by chemical reactions over a wide range of conditions, with temperature, pressure, and chemical potentials of all components be- ing the most important variables. The principles of thermodynamics, developed in chemistry to quantify chemical transformations, are directly applicable to these reactions. The formal deriva- tion of thermodynamic relationships will not be covered here and it is assumed that the reader has some background in elementary chemistry. Many of the quantitative derivations are not nec- essary to follow the rest of this book. Yet, at the end of this chapter, a student should be familiar with phase diagrams, and how they are related to the chemical properties of minerals. We introduce some basic concepts and illus- trate them with mineral examples. There are three main laws of thermodynamics that were formulated in the nineteenth century. The first law, based on the recognition by Robert Mayer in 1840 that heat (/Delta1Q )i se q u i v a l e n tt om e c h a n - ical work (/Delta1W), states that a change in the total internal energy of a system ( /Delta1E ) is equivalent to the heat transferred into the system minus the work performed by the system; that is, /Delta1E = /Delta1Q \u2212 /Delta1W. The total value of internal energy ( E ) cannot be readily quanti\ufb01ed, and in most cases we need to know only how E changes during a process or reaction. The second law of thermodynamics,p r o p o s e db y Rudolf Clausius in 1850, can be formulated in sev- eral different ways. Unlike in an ideal (reversible) p r o c e s s ,t h eh e a ta b s o r b e db yas y s t e mu n d e r - going an irreversible process is not equal to the work performed on the system. Part of the en- ergy is always lost in the process and cannot be retrieved. \u2018\u2018Irreversibility\u2019\u2019 is re\ufb02ected through c h a n g e si nt h ev a l u eo fe n t r o p yS, which is a measure of the degree of disorder in the sys- tem. Thus, for all irreversible processes, the sec- ond law of thermodynamics can be formulated as /Delta1S > Q /T , and for reversible processes, it can be stated as /Delta1S = Q /T , where T stands for absolute temperature. For example, two bodies at different temperatures will exchange heat, such that heat \ufb02ows from the hotter to the colder body. Both internal energy and entropy character- ize the state of a system, and they are indepen- dent of how that state has been reached. If C is the heat capacity, a scalar property that speci\ufb01es the heat maintained by a substance, then for any given compound whose entropy is known at a temperature T 1, an absolute value of S at T2", "page": 311}

It has been proved experimentally that all pure and perfectly ordered crystalline substances (i.e., all substances excluding solid so- lutions, glasses, and crystals with defects) have the same entropy at absolute zero temperature. This statement, known as the third law of thermo- dynamics, provides a useful reference frame. These fundamental laws of thermodynamics have pro- found implications for geological processes of all magnitudes. It should be emphasized, however, that kinet- ics (i.e., the rate at which reactions take place) is also important for mineral reactions.

{"text": "INTRODUCTION 289 and are not in chemical equilibrium. On cool- ing, reaction rates slow down, often to immea- surable rates at low temperature, and minerals that are stable at high temperature are preserved at room temperature. For example: cristobalite and tridymite, high-temperature SiO 2 phases, pre- cipitate in seawater; sanidine, the disordered K- feldspar in volcanic rocks, forms in sediments; and aragonite, the high-pressure polymorph of CaCO 3 is the main constituent of seashells. At higher temperatures, as during the crystalliza- tion of many metamorphic and igneous rocks, a closer approximation to equilibrium exists. How- ever, most minerals collected in the \ufb01eld or ana- lyzed in the laboratory are presently not in chem- ical equilibrium and this is used by petrologists to establish the conditions present during rock formation. Minerals are products of chemical reactions or polymorphic transformations. These always in- volve an assemblage (system )o fphases and chem- ical components (such as elements, oxides, etc.). There are open and closed systems, depending on whether matter can or cannot enter or leave the system. Thermodynamic principles allow us to analyze real or imaginary phases and chem- ical transformations within the system. A phase is a homogeneous and physically distinct part of the thermodynamic system that may be iso- lated mechanically from the system. It may be a solid, a liquid or a gas. Figure 17.1 shows a pres- sure versus temperature phase diagram for H 2O. Ice, vapor, and water are three coexisting phases at T = 298.16 K (0.01 \u25e6C) and P = 0.61 Pa, which is the invariant point, or triple point, for wa- ter. There are several high-pressure polymorphs of ice. Each mineral in a solidifying magma is a separate phase; the melt itself is a separate phase as long as it is homogeneous. A homogeneous gas mixture that has separated from the melt is an- other phase. Thermodynamic components are chemical con- stituents that can be used to describe completely the chemical compositions of the phases of a system. In principle we could use individual el- ements as chemical components, but it is sim- pler to use compounds. For example, the system containing the three phases ice, vapor, and water has one component, namely H 2O.

In the second, it coexists with a mixture of methane, oxygen, and water. These two very different thermodynamic systems reach equilibrium at some energy minimum that is different in the two cases. The mineral\u2019s stabil- ity is not determined by the minimum of the mineral\u2019s own energy, but by that of the system as a whole. Under different conditions the same ther- modynamic system will spontaneously reach its stable (equilibrium) state at a different energy minimum. The values of these minima may be de\ufb01ned by using thermodynamic potentials or internal energies (Table 17.1). These chemical potentials -- such as entropy, enthalpy, and Helmholtz or Gibbs potentials -- are material constants, similar to the physical properties discussed in Chapter 8. They depend on chemi- cal composition, bonding, and crystal structure, as well as on temperature and pressure. Values for these potentials are listed for standard con- ditions in handbooks (e.g., Wagman et al., 1982; Robie and Hemingway, 1995). Standard condi- tions usually refer to a temperature of 25 \u25e6C (298.15 K) and a pressure of 1 bar (0.1 MPa). In the following discussion we will sometimes use abso- lute values. Often relative values are important, for example energy differences between reactants and reaction products.

Enthalpy is measured in J /mol (or in kcal/mol) units, and, because calculations are in multiples of moles, the results are in J (or in kcal) units. Let us calculate /Delta1H 0 for a process at 25 \u25e6C and 0.1 MPa for the reaction between dolomite and quartz, which is a typical reaction for meta- morphism of limestones at high temperature and pressure: CaMg(CO3)2 + 2SiO2 \u21cc CaMg(Si2O6) + 2CO2 Dolomite Quartz Diopside Gas [17.1] The thermodynamic data for these substances are as follows: Enthalpy, /Delta1f H0 (k J/mol) Diopside \u22123210.68 CO2 \u2212393.51 Dolomite \u22122325.97 Quartz \u2212910.69 and, applying equation 17.2, we obtain /Delta1H 0 = [(\u22123210.68 k J/mol) \u00d7 1 mol + (\u2212393.51 k J/mol) \u00d7 2 mol] \u2212 [(\u22122325.97 k J/mol) \u00d7 1 mol + (\u2212910.69 k J/mol) \u00d7 2 mol] = (\u22123997.70 k J) \u2212 (\u22124147 k J) =+ 149.65 k J (17.3) This reaction [17.1] (left to right) is endothermic, which means that heat is absorbed. When heat is added to a substance (d Q ), the temperature increases (d T ). The scalar property that speci\ufb01es the heat maintained is called the heat capacity C and described with the expression dQ = C dT (17.4) Heat capacities are measured in J/(mol de- gree), and for the substances discussed above they have the following values: Heat capacity, C0 P ,298 (J/(mol degree)) Diopside 166.36 CO2 37.11 Dolomite 157.78 Quartz 46.64", "page": 315}

Heat capacities vary slightly with tempera- ture. It makes a difference if heat is added at con- stant pressure or constant volume, and usually the heat capacity at constant pressure C P is spec- i\ufb01ed. If we add heat Q t oac l o s e ds y s t e md u r i n g a reversible change in its state at constant pres- sure, we increase the enthalpy correspondingly. Therefore we can write dH = C P dT (17.5) The most common form of mechanical work W of a thermodynamic system is to expand against the constant pressure P of the surroundings. Mathematically, this is written as /Delta1W = P/Delta1V , where /Delta1V is the volume change. The \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics can then be expressed as dE = dQ \u2212 P dV (17.6) i.e., the change of internal energy E is the differ- ence between thermal energy Q and the expan- sion against pressure. The entropy S is involved in all thermody- namic potentials. It is measured in J /(degree mol) (or in cal/(degree mol)). Entropy is not easily de\ufb01ned, but it can be viewed as a mea- sure of internal disorder. It increases, for exam- ple, if a substance transforms from a highly or- dered crystalline state to a liquid or a gaseous state. But it can also vary within the solid state. For example, going from fully ordered micro- cline to sanidine with a disordered Si--Al distri- bution, and \ufb01nally to a feldspar glass with no long-range order in a regular lattice, S changes from 995.83 to 1100.94 to 1206.75 J /(degree mol). Among the Al 2SiO5 polymorphs, kyanite has the lowest entropy (92.17 J/(degree mol)). It is higher for andalusite (93.22 J/(degree mol)), and silli- manite (96.19 J/(degree mol)), but the differences are much smaller than for K-feldspar, since all three of these polymorphs are ordered crystal structures. The change of entropy in a system (/Delta1S 0)i s used in many thermodynamic calculations. The system entropy is equal to the weighted sum of entropies of formation ( S 0 f ) for the reaction prod- ucts minus that for the reactants /Delta1S0 = /Sigma1ni S0 f (products) (17.7) \u2212/Sigma1ni S0 f (reactants) where ni are the molar fractions of the compo- nents. The second law of thermodynamics stipulates that in any reversible process the change in en- tropy of the system (d S) is equal to the heat re- ceived by the system (dQ ) divided by the absolute temperature T : dS = dQ /T (17.8a) In an irreversible process, the change in entropy o ft h es y s t e mi sl a r g e rt h a", "page": 316}

Table 17.1 gives equilibrium restrictions for enthalpy: d S = 0a n dd P = 0. In the example above, P is constant and therefore d P = 0, whereas the entropy of the system greatly in- creases because a gas phase forms. Thus dS \u0338=0, and the equilibrium restriction for using S is not satis\ufb01ed. At this point in our discussion, we can draw no conclusions as to whether this reaction is possible or not, at either 25 or 500 \u25e6C. We will explore this question in the next section. Calcite\u2013aragonite transformation: Gibbs free energy In order to account for changes in both en- tropy and enthalpy, J. Willard Gibbs de\ufb01ned a new function, which we now call the Gibbs free energy (Gibbs potential) G . This function is inde- pendent of variations in pressure and tempera- ture and can be stated as G = H \u2212 TS (17.13) where H is enthalpy and S is entropy. The Gibbs free energy depends only on the state of a system, not on how this state has been attained. The change in free energy asso- ciated with the formation of a compound from its constituent elements under standard condi- tions (25 \u25e6C and 0.1 MPa) is termed the standard Gibbs free energy of formation ( /Delta1G 0 f )a n dm e a - sured in J /mol (or in kcal/mol). Gibbs potentials for elements are by de\ufb01nition zero. The change of Gibbs free energy of a chemical reaction in the standard state (25 \u25e6C and 0.1 MPa) is /Delta1G 0 = /Delta1H 0 \u2212 T /Delta1S0 (17.14) From Table 17.1, a spontaneously occurring reaction requires that d G < 0; hence changes in entropy and enthalpy work together to de- \ufb01ne whether or not the process may occur spon- taneously. Reactions that result in more order (dS < 0) will occur spontaneously if the heat ex- pelled during the process is greater than the increase in G due to the decrease in entropy. And, vice versa, reactions absorbing heat (d H > 0) will occur if the decrease in the Gibbs potential due to the increase in entropy outweighs the increase in G due to the heat absorption. Indeed, in comparison with H (Table 17.1), the conditions necessary for the application of the Gibbs potential (namely pressure and tempera- ture invariability) are most easily understood and most readily measured. Therefore evaluations of the Gibbs potential are frequently used to analyze the formation processes of various substances, both by chemists and mineralogists. A change of G in a system during some process (/Delta1G 0 of the p r o c e s s )a t2 5\u25e6C( \u2248 298 K) and 0.1 MPa pressure (standard conditions) is equal to /Delta1G 0 = \u2211 ni /Delta1G 0 f (products) \u2212 \u2211 ni /Delta1G 0 f (reactants) (17.15) The /Delta1G 0 f values (free energy to form", "page": 317}

At equilibrium /Delta1G 0, the free energy of the reaction, is zero. This can be used to determine the pressure at which cal- cite and aragonite are in equilibrium at 25 \u25e6C. To answer this question, we \ufb01rst consider the difference in molar volume V 0 at 298 K between aragonite and calcite, which is /Delta1V 0 298 = 1 mol \u00d7 34.15 cm3/mol Aragonite (\ufb01nal composition) \u22121 mol \u00d7 36.93 cm3/mol =\u2212 2.78 cm3 Calcite (initial composition) (17.17) Since aragonite has the smaller molar volume, it is favored at high pressure. Using this value, we can then calculate the pressure P at which arag- onite and calcite are in equilibrium at 25 \u25e6C, i.e., the pressure at which the free energy of the reac- tion /Delta1G 0 P ,T = 0. To obtain the Gibbs free energy /Delta1G 0 P at pressure P we have to add, to the Gibbs free energy at standard conditions /Delta1G 0 T obtained in equation 17.17, the mechanical work due to volume change: /Delta1G 0 P ,T = /Delta1G 0 T + P /Delta1V 0 298 (17.18) Because at equilibrium /Delta1G 0 P ,T = 0, we can write: 0 =+ 0.970 k J + P (\u22122.78 cm3). Correspondingly, we obtain P = 0.970 k J/2.78 cm3 = 349 J/cm3 = 349 MPa equilibrium pressure for the transforma- tion from calcite to aragonite at 25 \u25e6C, where 1.00 MPa cm3 is a conversion factor from joules to MPa cm3 units (see Box 17.1). This gives us one point on the line that separates the stability \ufb01elds of cal- cite and aragonite in the temperature--pressure phase diagram (Figure 17.2a). For differential temperature and pressure changes during a reaction we can use the fol- lowing expression of the \ufb01rst law (see Table 17.1, bottom): /Delta1G 0 T ,P = /Delta1V dP \u2212 /Delta1S0dT (17.19) At equilibrium, /Delta1G 0 T ,P = 0 and, correspondingly (using equation 17.4), dP /dT = /Delta1S0//Delta1V = /Delta1H 0 T /(T /Delta1V ) (17.20) This relationship, known as the Clausius-- Clapeyron equation, de\ufb01nes the slope of the equilibrium line on the pressure--temperature phase diagram at the position of the point cal- culated above. Because only one variable ( P or T ) can be assigned arbitrarily along this line, it is said to be univariant.

From this we can \ufb01nish constructing the P --T phase diagram shown in Figure 17.2a. Note that in this diagram the line along which the two minerals coexist is more or less straight because in solids the volume difference between two polymorphs is roughly constant and does not change much with pressure and temperature. Figure 17.2b gives a phase diagram for the alu- minosilicate polymorphs andalusite, kyanite, and sillimanite (Al 2SiO5), which are important com- ponents of metamorphic rocks and whose pres- ence can be used to estimate P --T formation con- ditions. Also in this diagram phase boundaries are straight because we are dealing with solids, but the Clausius--Clapeyron slopes between the phases are very different. The boundary kyan- ite/sillimanite has a positive slope whereas the boundary andalusite/sillimanite has a negative slope. The Clausius--Clapeyron slope is signi\ufb01cant because it determines the change of stability of a mineral with pressure. Stability of malachite and azurite: mass action law and partial gas pressure phase diagrams The thermodynamic potentials and phase dia- grams, such as those shown in Figure 17.2, refer only to the ultimate results of a process; they do not provide any information on how easy (or dif\ufb01cult) it is for a system to reach equilibrium. In other words, a system may be far from equi- librium, but it is prevented from attaining equi- librium by the sluggishness of the process. There are countless examples of such sluggish processes in the geological environment, including devitri- \ufb01cation of volcanic glasses and the metastable existence of high-pressure and high-temperature minerals (e.g., diamond and coesite). To a \ufb01rst approximation, the rate of a reaction such as aA + bB \u21cc cC + dD depends on the con- centrations a, b, c, d o ft h ec o m p o n e n t sA ,B ,C ,D that are involved. At equilibrium, the rates of the forward (left side) and backward (right side) reac- tions are the same, and this condition is stated in the general mass action law that introduces the equilibrium constant k: ac Cad D aa Aab B = k (17.22) where ax are activities of the components. Activi- ties are used if the components are dissolved in a solution, or if a mixture of gases is present. The pressure of air, for example, is the sum of the par- tial pressures of its individual components such as nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The sum of all partial pressures is the total pressure, and the sum of activities adds to 1.0. The activities for solids and liquids involved in the reaction are 1.0. For ideal gases (VP = RT for one mole of gas, where R is the gas constant; see Box 17.1), there is a simple correspondence between the Gibbs free energy G and the", "page": 319}

The partial pressure of CO 2 at which the two minerals coexist in equilibrium is thus (equation 17.25): log pCO2 =\u2212 0.13 (17.26) Since pCO2 at near-surface conditions is about 10\u22123.5 MPa (log pCO2 =\u2212 3.5), malachite is the more stable mineral (see the phase diagram in Figure 17.3a). Garrels and Christ (1990) cited an interesting example for this mineralogical equi- librium: on many old paintings the sky has a greenish color. Paints made from blue azurite have transformed over time to the more stable green malachite. Similar approaches can be applied to any min- eral assemblage. Let us consider quartz-bearing limestones undergoing metamorphism. At high temperature the silicate mineral wollastonite (CaSiO 3) forms as a result of the following reaction: CaCO3 + SiO2 \u21cc CaSiO3 + CO2 Calcite Quartz Wollastonite The equilibrium constant k of this reaction is numerically equal to the partial pressure of CO 2: k = pCO2 or log k = log pCO2 (17.27) From (equation 17.23b) it follows that log pCO2 =\u2212 /Delta1G 0 T ,P /(2.303RT ) (17.28) Using this equation we can calculate the P --T phase diagram shown in Figure 17.3b. Because the value of /Delta1G depends linearly on temperature and logarithmically on pressure, the equilibrium line separating the stability \ufb01elds is not a straight line as it was between calcite and aragonite, but rather is curved. This shape is typical of reactions involving a gas phase (e.g., CO 2).

We can write the following equilibrium equation for the dissociation of water: H 2O \u21cc H+ + OH\u2212 Solutions where aH+ > aOH\u2212 are called acid, and those where aH+ < aOH\u2212 are termed alkaline. So- lutions where aH+ = aOH\u2212 ,s u c ha sp u r ew a t e r (above), are neutral. For very dilute solutions, the activity of H 2O is a constant and we obtain for the equilibrium constant k = aH+ \u00d7 aOH\u2212 (17.29) At 25 \u25e6C, k has a value of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221214. Since aH+ is generally much smaller than 1.0, pH =\u2212 log aH+ has been introduced as a measure to describe the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, with pH ranging between 0 and 14. Solutions with a low pH value are acidic, while those with a high pH are alkaline. The pH for pure water at 25 \u25e6C is 7.0 ( aH+ = aOH\u2212 = \u221a10\u221214). Most natural waters have a pH between 4 and 9. Many reactions taking place near the earth\u2019s surface in aqueous solutions can be described in terms of the energetics of the exchange of elec- trons and the activity of free H +. When an atom or ion gains an electron, its valence is decreased and the element is said to be reduced. If it loses an electron, it is oxidized. Oxidation--reduction reactions are often referred to as redox reactions. The ease with which the loss or gain of an electron takes place depends on the energy re- quired to dislodge an electron from an outer shell and is measured as electrical work. This process is best understood in terms of a galvanic cell con- sisting of two half-cells, each with a metal elec- trode and an electrolyte (Figure 17.4). For exam- ple, in one half-cell we may have a zinc electrode with Zn 2+ in solution in sulfuric acid, whereas in the other cell we have a copper electrode with Cu 2+ in solution. Metal ions are prevented from mixing by a porous partition. If the two elec- trodes are connected, reactions occur. At the zinc electrode, metallic Zn gives up two electrons and dissolves as Zn 2+.

Such Eh--pH diagrams are widely used in in- vestigations of mineral equilibria, where aqueous solutions are present and oxidation--reduction re- actions occur. Note that the condition Eh = E 0 is not a statement of equilibrium, but rather im- plies that the activities of all products and all re- actants in a solution are unitary. The true equilib- rium is achieved only when Eh = 0, /Delta1G r = 0, and pressure and temperature remain constant. Eh-- pH diagrams help us to understand the equilib- rium of minerals and ions in seawater, in weath- ering oxidation processes, and in hydrothermal transformations. Phase rule The phase rule relates the number of minerals (phases) to the number of components in a sys- tem, and the number of possible reactions. It can be proven that in any thermodynamic system the number of phases p, the number of components c, and the number of degrees of freedom f are related in the following manner: p = c + m \u2212 f (17.39) where the number m denotes the external pa- rameters that have an effect on the state of the system. The number of degrees of freedom f cor- responds to a number of thermodynamic parame- ters that are allowed to change without affecting the state of the system and its phase composi- tion. In mineralogical systems such parameters are usually represented by external pressure, tem- perature, and chemical potentials. The more complex the chemical composition of a geological system, and the more external fac- tors affecting it, the greater the number of min- erals expected to occur in this system. For those geological systems, where the formation of min- erals is only temperature and pressure dependent (m = 2): p = c + 2 \u2212 f (17.40) The cooling of a magmatic melt is an exam- ple. Such a system ideally has an invariable bulk chemical composition. The external factors are largely temperature and pressure changes that cause crystallization processes in the melt. It is obvious that both pressure", "page": 324}

Goldschmidt as the mineralogical phase rule, states that in geo- logical systems, where temperature and pressure are the only external factors that may vary arbi- trarily, the maximum number of minerals that may coexist in equilibrium is equal to the num- ber of chemical components. In a P --T phase diagram (e.g., Figure 17.2a,b) the stability \ufb01elds of minerals have two degrees of freedom, since both pressure and temperature change independently. The lines separating sta- bility \ufb01elds correspond to one degree of freedom because only one parameter (either temperature or pressure) can vary independently. Junctions of lines (triple points) have no degrees of freedom. The equilibrium conditions described above are correspondingly called divariant, univariant, and invariant, respectively.", "page": 324}

The lines indicate the univariant coexistence condi- tions of mineral pairs (kyanite \u21cc andalusite; kyanite \u21cc sillimanite; sillimanite \u21cc andalusite). The \ufb01elds between the lines correspond to the bivariant stability conditions of one mineral. There are three phases (three minerals) and one component (Al 2SiO5) in the andalusite--kyanite-- sillimanite system. At the invariant point, f is zero. Thus, the highest possible number of coex- isting phases p i s3( p = 1 + 2 \u2212 0 = 3). Similarly, anywhere on the line of univariant equilibrium f = 1. Thus p is equal to 2 (p = 1 + 2 \u2212 1 = 2). Fi- nally, within any \ufb01eld between the lines, f = 2. Therefore, p is equal to 1 ( p = 1 + 2 \u2212 2 = 1). One of the major drawbacks of equation 17.40 is that many geological systems behave as open systems that are capable of exchanging volatile components with their surroundings, and hence c becomes a variable. Dmitriy Korzhinskiy (1959) suggested that the phase rule had to be modi\ufb01ed to account for the number of components that migrate in or out of the system, i.e., that behave as the mobile components M : p = c + 2 \u2212 f \u2212 M (17.42) In this modi\ufb01ed form, the mineralogical phase rule states that, in geological systems, the max- imum number of minerals that may coexist in equilibrium is equal to the number of inert com- ponents. Phase diagrams Mineral (phase) equilibrium diagrams show the limits of stable existence of minerals at differ- ent conditions. They are plotted either on the basis of thermodynamic calculations and the phase rule, as illustrated in the previous sections, or as a graphic representation of experimental results. Phase diagrams, as a rule, are plotted as a function of two variables such as: r temperature T versus total pressure P (Figure 17.2); r temperature T versus partial pressure p (Figure 17.3b) (or fugacity f , activity a,p H ) ; r partial pressure px versus partial pressure py (or activity versus activity, etc.); r oxidation--reduction potential Eh versus pH (Figure 17.5); r temperature T versus composition of system X. More rarely three variables are used, for example activity versus pH versus composition or temper- ature versus pressure versus composition.

Diagrams for crystallization from a melt The binary system diopside (CaMgSi 2O6)-- anorthite (CaAl 2Si2O8) (Figure 17.6) is a classical example and has direct application to our under- standing of crystallization processes in basaltic magmas. There are two components (CaMgSi 2O6 and CaAl 2Si2O8) and one free parameter (tem- perature, m = 1) in this system. The solid lines correspond to the univariant equilibrium be- tween two phases ( p = c + 1 \u2212 f = 2 + 1 \u2212 1 = 2 for equation 17.39), which are a mineral (anor- thite or diopside) and a melt. At the E-point, where the two univariant lines meet, the number of degrees of freedom is zero, while the number of coexisting phases is three (p = c + 1 \u2212 f = 2 + 1 \u2212 0 = 3): diopside, anorthite, and melt. E is called the eutectic point and corresponds to the lowest temperature at which the melt and solid phases can coexist.

With further cooling, the composition of the melt shifts to the left, since anorthite has been extracted as crystals. The relative amounts of crystals and remaining melt can be derived with the help of the lever rule shown with the diagram on the right-hand side (Figure 17.6). (It is called lever rule because it balances crystals and liquid according to their relative amounts.) For exam- ple, at temperature T 2 the distance I2 \u2212A is di- vided into I2 \u2212 X2 (crystals) and X2 \u2212 A (melt). At temperature T2 (1400 \u25e6C )t h ec r y s t a l so fa n o r t h i t e comprise 32% while the melt comprises 68%. The composition of the melt corresponds to that at point I 2 (40% CaMgSi2O6 and 60% CaAl2Si2O8). As the temperature decreases, more anorthite crys- tallizes, the volume of the melt decreases, and its composition changes towards CaMgSi 2O6.A t temperature T3 (1270 \u25e6C) the anorthite crystals comprise 52%, and the melt 48%, again applying the lever rule. The composition of the remaining melt is 42% CaAl 2Si2O8 and 58% CaMgSi 2O6. At the eutectic temperature T3 diopside may coexist with anorthite and melt in equilibrium, but the slightest loss of heat causes the si- multaneous crystallization of the two minerals. The temperature remains constant until both minerals are fully crystallized. Only at this point does the system continue to cool. The resultant rock has a microstructure with euhedral anorthite crystals (which crystallized freely in the melt as phenocrysts) within a mass of intergrown anorthite and diopside that crys- tallized at the same time (the groundmass) (cf. Fig- ure 12.1a). The ratio of total diopside and anor- thite in the aggregate is the same as the initial ratio between the corresponding components in the melt X, i.e., 75% anorthite and 25% diopside. However, within the groundmass the proportion is different and corresponds to the composition of the melt at the eutectic E-point (58% diopside and 42% anorthite).

{"text": "Chapter 18 Solid solutions Crystallization of solid solutions from a melt In Chapter 17 we explored phase diagrams and stability relations in systems with different min- erals of well-de\ufb01ned compositions. In this chap- ter we will discuss some aspects of solid so- lutions, where compositions are variable. The \ufb01rst issue is the melting and crystallization behavior. Solid solutions have a peculiar melting be- havior. For example, in the olivine system (Fe 2SiO4--Mg2SiO4), which is an example of a dis- ordered and homogeneous solid solution, fay- alite (Fe 2SiO4) has a melting point that is over 685 \u25e6C lower than that of forsterite (Mg 2SiO4) (Figure 18.1). When a melt of composition 50% Fe2SiO4--50% Mg2SiO4 (X) cools to temperature T1 (on the upper curve, which corresponds to the liquidus), crys- tallization begins. The composition of the olivine crystal is given by the lower curve (the solidus) at the point x 1. Since the crystal is enriched in mag- nesium (80% Mg 2SiO4, 20% Fe 2SiO4), the remain- ing melt becomes enriched in iron. Upon fur- ther cooling the composition of the melt changes along the liquidus and that of the crystal along the solidus (from point x 1 to point x3).I nt h i s phase diagram there is melt above the liquidus, melt and crystal at conditions between the liq- uidus and solidus, and only crystal below the solidus. Using some thermodynamic arguments we can analytically derive this rather compli- cated diagram; an example of such a derivation is illustrated for another important system, pla- gioclase feldspar, in Box 18.1. The composition of an olivine grain that in- teracts with the cooling melt changes gradually towards Fe 2SiO4. If our system behaved as ideal, and the crystals continuously equilibrated with the melt to yield more iron-rich compositions, the crystallization process would \ufb01nally cease at temperature T 3, where the composition of the crystals is identical with that of their parental liquid. However, natural systems never behave as ideal: some of the early-precipitated crystals are removed from the system by gravitational set- tling or grow so rapidly that they have no chance to equilibrate. In such cases, lesser amounts of the low-melting-point component are extracted from the melt to equilibrate the early crystals, and the liquid becomes even more enriched in that component. As a result, even when tem- perature T 3 is reached, there is still some melt available, and crystallization continues further towards fayalite. Crystallization of olivine in the geological environment most typically follows a non-equilibrium path producing crystals with a magnesium-rich core and an iron-rich rim. Many ferromagnesian silicates (micas, amphiboles, py- roxenes) show a similar behavior.

Exsolution diagrams At high temperatures, alkali feldspars form a con- tinuous solid solution with a homogeneous crys- tal. As we have discussed brie\ufb02y in Chapter 6 (con- cerning crystal defects) and will further empha- size in Chapter 19 (when we turn our attention to feldspars), the attraction of unlike atoms in a solid solution leads to an ordering upon cooling (see Figure 6.11). Vice versa, the attraction of like atoms causes separation of a homogeneous crys- tal into local domains of differing composition, and we call this exsolution. Ordering and exsolu- tion occur after a host crystal has solidi\ufb01ed, and are therefore called a subsolidus transformation. The subsolidus behavior of a solid solu- tion crystal can be understood by considering variations of the Gibbs free energy /Delta1G with composition and evaluating which system has", "page": 329}

Each process requires diffusion, at least on a local scale, and exsolution is therefore sluggish. Ho- mogeneous crystals can be preserved if they are quenched rapidly, as in some volcanic rocks. Some mechanisms occur by nucleation of the new, pure phases. Since nuclei form only when the system is cooled below the equilibrium solvus, the actual \u2018\u2018coherent\u2019\u2019 solvus curve (dashed line in Figure 18.4b) is depressed and exsolution occurs at a lower temperature.

{"text": "Chapter 19 Important information about silica minerals and feldspars Introduction We begin our discussion of speci\ufb01c mineral classes with the two most common constituents of the earth\u2019s crust: quartz and feldspar. From ag e n e t i cp o i n to fv i e ws u c hap r i o r i t yi sj u s t i - \ufb01ed. They are present in most rocks and, without knowledge of them, it is dif\ufb01cult to discuss ig- neous, metamorphic, and sedimentary mineral- forming processes. It is true that quartz, and particularly feldspars, display some of the most complex crystal structures, the details of some of which are not yet understood. In this context we will not dwell on intricate details but use silica minerals and feldspar to illustrate the principles of phase transformations and polymorphism that were introduced in earlier chapters. After a dis- cussion of the minerals we will show how they form in granite and highlight some of the fea- tures of this rock of which much of the conti- nental crust is composed. Silica minerals The silica minerals, with an overall composi- tion SiO 2, include many polymorphs (Table 19.1). Quartz is the most common member, occurring both in a trigonal low-temperature form ( /H9251- quartz) and a hexagonal high-temperature form ( /H9252-quartz). Other important silica polymorphs are /H9251-a n d /H9252-tridymite, /H9251-a n d /H9252-cristobalite, coesite, and stishovite. Opal is a solid silica gel con- taining a large amount of water. The stability \ufb01elds of some silica polymorphs are shown in Figure 19.1. In all these polymorphs, except for stishovite, silicon is surrounded (coordinated) by four oxygen atoms, forming a tetrahedral SiO 4\u2212 4 group (Figure 19.2a). The corners of the tetrahedron r e p r e s e n to x y g e na t o m s ,a n das i l i c o na t o mi s in the center. Often the atoms are omitted in the representation and only the corners of the tetrahedron are shown. The edges represent O--O bonds (Figure 19.2b). A tetrahedron that is viewed along an apex looks like a trigonal pyramid (Fig- ure 19.2c). The bonds between silicon and oxy- gen are complex ionic--covalent. The tetrahedra build up an in\ufb01nite three-dimensional frame- work by sharing each oxygen corner with another tetrahedron. There are many ways such linkages can be made, and the manner in which link- age occurs determines the resultant crystal struc- tures of the various polymorphs. Their symmetry may be cubic, hexagonal, tetragonal, trigonal, or- thorhombic, or monoclinic. Although the basic building unit, the tetrahedron, is very simple, the ways of combining the tetrahedra in a crys- tal structure are intricate and diverse. You may \ufb01nd some analogies in the polymerization of SiO 2 with hydrocarbons. The simplest silica polymorph structure is that of tridymite, in which SiO 4\u2212 4 tetrahedra link to hexagonal rings and the rings link further to an in\ufb01nite hexagonal net (Figure 19.3a).

Every third layer is exactly on top of the \ufb01rst layer. Such a stacking se- quence of layers may be designated as AB--AB-- AB. This (slightly idealized) /H9252-tridymite is a high- temperature polymorph and occurs in volcanic rocks. However, this structure crystallizes easily and is also favored (kinetically, not thermody- namically) at low temperature, when silica, for example, precipitates from seawater as skeletons of diatoms.

Cristobalite (also occurring in volcanic rocks and siliceous sediments) is a modi\ufb01cation of the tridymite structure (Figure 19.3c). In this case all layers are the same (i.e., adjacent layers are not related by mirror symmetry), but displaced to ob- tain connectivity between layers. The scheme is illustrated in Figure 19.3c, with three layers A, B, and C. The fourth layer is again exactly above the \ufb01rst layer and de\ufb01nes a stacking order ABC--ABC rather than AB--AB as in hexagonal tridymite. This is analogous to hexagonal and cubic close- packing in metals; indeed the ideal structure of cristobalite is also cubic (Figure 19.4b). Coesite is a rare high-pressure polymorph of SiO 2 that occurs at meteorite impact sites and in ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic rocks. In the monoclinic structure of coesite, rings of four tetrahedra are linked to chains, and the lower chains are linked by a second higher set of chains, connecting the free tetrahedral apices (Figure 19.4a). Silicon in coesite is in tetrahedral coordination as in cristobalite (Figure 19.4b). The second high-pressure polymorph, stishovite, is fundamentally different: each silicon atom is surrounded by six oxygen atoms in the shape of an octahedron, and these octahedra are linked by sharing edges and corners similar to the titanium oxide mineral rutile (see Chapter 25). The ionic radius ratio for Si 4+:O 2\u2212 conforms to tetrahedral coordination (Chapter 2). However, at very high pressures, oxygen atoms are no longer ideally spherical and then octahedral co- ordination allows for denser packing. Stishovite", "page": 338}

So far, stishovite has been found only in meteor craters where siliceous rocks have been transformed by shock pressures during a meteorite impact. It may also occur in the earth\u2019s lower mantle. The mineral /H9251-quartz comprises about 13% of the earth\u2019s crust and, after feldspars, is the sec- ond most abundant mineral. As in tridymite and cristobalite, the structure of quartz consists of an in\ufb01nite three-dimensional framework of linked SiO 4\u2212 4 tetrahedra. Each corner of a tetrahedron is shared with another one and we can only count it as one half per tetrahedron, resulting in an overall oxygen content of 4 \u00d7 1 2 = 2 and one sil- icon per tetrahedron, i.e., a molecular composi- tion SiO 2. The framework structure of quartz is more complex than that of either tridymite or cristo- balite. Figure 19.5a shows a projection of hexag- onal /H9252-quartz along the c-axis. Careful inspec- tion of the structure reveals two 3-fold spirals of tetrahedra, resembling a screw (indicated by ar- rows). Tetrahedra are brought to coincidence by a counter-clockwise 120 \u25e6 rotation and a one third translation ( z-coordinates of Si 4+ in the center of tetrahedra in the lower right side are labeled and equivalent ones are marked with the same shading). As was brie\ufb02y discussed in Chapter 6, hexag- onal /H9252-quartz exists only above 573 \u25e6C. Upon cooling, tetrahedra become tilted, resulting in a less symmetrical trigonal structure (Figure 19.5b) ( /H9251-quartz). This transformation involves only slight displacements of atoms, with no breakage of bonds, and is therefore instanta- neous and reversible. Depending on the hand- edness of the screw, two varieties of quartz can be distinguished: left-handed quartz with a counter-clockwise rotation (Figure 19.5b) and right-handed quartz with a clockwise rotation for the spirals (Figure 19.5c). Both the symmetry and the handedness are expressed in the morphology. Ideally, crystals of hexagonal /H9252-quartz show the six well-developed faces of a hexagonal prism m = {10\u00af10} and are capped above and below by a bipyramid r = {10\u00af11} (Figure 19.6a).

In trigonal /H9251-quartz six faces at every apex of the crystal consist of two rhombohedra. One rhom- bohedron r = {10\u00af11} is generally larger than the other z = {01\u00af11}, which is rotated 60 \u25e6 relative to {10\u00af11} (Figure 19.6c,d). The handedness is ex- pressed in the disposition of minor forms such as x = {51\u00af61} (Figure 19.6c versus d). A charac- teristic feature of quartz is a horizontal stria- tion on the prism faces (see Figure 5.28, Plate 6c). The striation originates from minute growth steps during combined prismatic and rhombohe- dral growth. We have seen earlier that the mor- phology is also indicative of formation conditions (see Figures 16.9 and 16.10). Twin intergrowths are very common in quartz (see discussion in Chapter 5). Brazil twins are an intergrowth of left- and right-handed quartz, both related by a center of symmetry (see Figure 5.16c). Dauphin \u00b4e twins in trigonal /H9251-quartz are related by a 2-fold rotation about the c-axis (see Figure 5.16b). The names of the twin laws are af- ter localities where specimens were \ufb01rst found. During the phase transformation from hexag- onal to trigonal quartz, displacement of oxygen atoms may occur in one of two possible direc- tions (as indicated by differently sized arrows in Figure 19.7a). The two possible con\ufb01gurations are r e l a t e db ya6 0 \u25e6 (180\u25e6) rotation about the c-axis, i.e., they have a twin relationship. Different parts of a crystal may choose one or the other trigonal arrangement, resulting in Dauphin \u00b4e twins. Such transformation twins on a \ufb01ne scale have been ob- served via electron microscopy at temperatures in the vicinity of the /H9251--/H9252phase transformation (Figure 19.8). Yet another origin for Dauphin \u00b4e twins in quartz is mechanical. If we project the crys- tal structure along the c-axis (Figure 19.7b), we notice that, in /H9251-quartz, alternating tetrahedral apices (oxygen atoms) along the spiral of tetra- hedra are closer and further removed from the rotation axis, respectively. If a shear stress is ap- plied, this order can be reversed by a slight dis- placement, without breaking any bonds (top and bottom part in Figure 19.7c). Such con\ufb01guration pairs are called deformation (or mechanical) twins because they are caused by shearing stress. The structural features of quartz are ex- pressed in its properties. Strong, partially cova- lent bonds and the three-dimensional framework are responsible for the great hardness of quartz (Mohs\u2019 scale 7) and its lack of cleavage and con- choidal fracture. The open framework is the rea- son for the low density (2.65", "page": 340}

Since the structure lacks mirror planes and a center of sym- metry, quartz displays piezoelectricity (Chapter 8) and optical activity (Chapter 9).", "page": 340}

Feldspars have fascinated generations of miner- alogists, and in the 1950s there were revealing pioneering studies into the heterogeneous crys- tal structures of feldspars (see Box 19.1). The structure of feldspars is related to that of silica minerals: the SiO 4\u2212 4 tetrahedron is the main building element and tetrahedra are linked to a three-dimensional framework, though the framework is less symmetrical than in quartz. One difference between feldspars and silica min- erals is that in the former some of the Si 4+ are replaced by Al3+. In feldspars all aluminum is in tetrahedral coordination, and the feldspars are therefore chemically referred to as alumosilicates as opposed to aluminosilicates in which at least some Al 3+ is in octahedral coordination. The SiO2 framework in silica minerals is charge balanced. To balance the charges in feldspars, caused by the Si--Al substitution, additional cations need to be added and are placed in the cavities within the framework. Large alkali and alkaline earth atoms are introduced, leading to considerable variation in chemical composition. Most feldspars in rocks are solid solutions with variable amounts of potassium, sodium, calcium, and some barium. Their names and compositional ranges are sum- marized in Figure 19.9a in a triangular diagram (instructions on how to use and read ternary dia- grams have been given in Box 14.1). The pure end members are anorthite (CaAl 2Si2O8; Ca-feldspar, abbreviated An); albite (NaAlSi3O8; Na-feldspar or Ab); and the K-feldspars (KAlSi 3O8) sanidine, or- thoclase, and microcline (usually referred to as Or). The composition of feldspars is often ex- pressed in percentages (given as subscripts) of the three end members anorthite, albite, and orthoclase, for example An 10Ab85Or5. The series between albite and orthoclase is known as the alkali feldspars. The series between albite and anorthite is known as the plagioclase feldspars or simply plagioclase. Additional varietal names are assigned to plagioclases on the basis of their composition: oligoclase (An 10--An30), andesine", "page": 342}
{"text": "320 QUARTZ AND FELDSPARS. GRANITE AND PEGMATITE Box 19.1 Feldspars: a historical note It is an understatement to claim that feldspar structures are complicated. In fact many detailed structural features of this most common mineral, including the crys- tal structure of intermediate plagioclase and the plagioclase phase diagram, still elude a satisfactory interpretation. The basic structure of feldspar was determined from X-ray diffraction data in 1933 by W.H. Taylor at the University of Cambridge, England. Subsequently Cambridge University became a focus for feldspar inves- tigations, with permanent and visiting researchers, such as Helen Megaw (who dared a \ufb01rst interpretation of Al\u2013Si ordering in these silicates), S.G. Fleet and Paul H. Ribbe (who were the \ufb01rst to document chemical heterogeneities by electron microscopy), and Joe V. Smith (who later published a most comprehensive book on feldspars). Different groups, approaching the feldspar problem from the exper- imental side, worked in the USA at the University of Chicago (Julian R. Goldsmith, Fritz Laves and, later, Joe V. Smith) and the Geophysical Laboratory at Washington, DC (T om F.W. Barth). Particularly between the universities of Cambridge and Zurich (where Laves later resided) a not always friendly competition developed, as we can see in the published discussion between Laves and Megaw in one of the \ufb01rst feldspar conferences in Spain, in 1961. Laves and Goldsmith begin their 1961 paper entitled \u201cPolymorphism, order, disorder, diffusion and confusion in the feldspars\u201d by pointing out \u201cthere is a good deal of discussion on the problems of the feldspars and a certain amount of confusion is apparent. With the risk of adding to the confusion by further contributing to the discussion, we should like to stress anew some old ideas ...\u201d . I t illustrates the enormous complexities in these minerals, produced by competing processes of ordering with attraction of unlike atoms (Si and Al) and exsolution with attraction of like atoms (K and Na). If you have time you may \ufb01nd it fascinating (and sometimes amusing) to read some of the early papers on feldspar structures and then compare them with the present state of knowledge, summarized, for example, in the book by Smith and Brown (1988), or the proceedings of a recent feldspar conference (e.g., Parsons, 1994). (An30--An50), labradorite (An50--An70), and bytown- ite (An70--An90). This range in composition for plagioclase can be understood if we consider some basic prin- ciples of crystal chemistry: Na + and Ca 2+ have similar radii (1.16 and 1.12 \u02daA for coordination number 8, respectively) and substitution is easy, accounting for the wide occurrence of intermedi- ate compositions. The substitution is special be- cause it replaces atoms of similar size but differ- ent charge. To balance the overall charge, a simul- taneous replacement of Si 4+ by Al3+ has to occur, resulting in a chemical composition of NaAlSi3O8 for albite and CaAl 2Si2O8 for anorthite. In the substitution of alkali ions, the ionic radius of Na + (1.16 \u02daA for coordination num- ber 8) is considerably smaller than that of K +", "page": 343}

This would involve both discrepancies in size and complications with charge balance.

The or- dering pattern is controlled by the fact that ad- jacent Al tetrahedra exert strong repulsions, and thus such an arrangement is very unstable (the Al--O--Al avoidance rule; Loewenstein, 1954). In the high-temperature polymorph sanidine, above about 530 \u25e6C, all four tetrahedral sites are occupied randomly by Al (1/4) and Si (3/4). Such an arrangement has a mirror plane normal to y and therefore monoclinic symmetry (space-group C 2/m) (Figure 19.11a). At lower temperature, or upon slow cooling, the Al/Si distribution becomes ordered. At \ufb01rst there is a tendency for Al to oc- cupy T 1 sites and for Si to occupy T2 sites. Finally, when ordering is complete, Al is concentrated on T 1(m), and this eliminates the mirror plane. The fully ordered polymorph microcline is triclinic (space-group C \u00af1) (Figure 19.11b). (AC -centered tri- clinic unit cell is used for microcline and albite to maintain the relationship with the monoclinic C -centered unit cell of sanidine.) Al can choose the T 1 site on either the left or the right side of the monoclinic mirror plane. Often two regions in the crystal behave differently during ordering, causing some to distort to the left and some to the right. The two regions are related by a mir- ror re\ufb02ection and appear as twins (Figure 19.12a). Such microscopic or submicroscopic twins (\u2018\u2018Al- bite twinning\u2019\u2019 on (010), \u2018\u2018Pericline twinning\u2019\u2019 on [010], or both combined in a cross-hatched pat- tern) are common in the K-feldspar microcline that can form during cooling and corresponding Al/Si ordering (Figure 19.12b, Plate 3d). One application of the Al/Si ordering state in alkali feldspars to broader geological ques- tions is in the determination of the cooling his- tory of igneous rocks. A good example is pro- vided by Tertiary intrusions into Precambrian gneisses in Colorado, USA. Before the intrusion, all alkali feldspar in the gneisses was triclinic microcline. In the vicinity of the contact, how- ever, the microcline became disordered, and we now see a boundary between triclinic micro- cline and monoclinic orthoclase that represents a 500 \u25e6C isotherm (Figure 19.13). Notice that in some places the isotherm is close to the contact with the surface,", "page": 345}

This is best visualized in an x--z section in which four-membered rings of tetrahe- dra share corners to form a chain along z = [001]. In ordered albite (AlSi3), tetrahedral motifs along the z-axis repeat every 7 \u02daA (Figure 19.14a). How- ever, in anorthite (Al 2Si2), Al and Si tetrahedra must alternate to avoid Al--O--Al bonds, causing a doubling of c (Figure 19.14b). Since the unit cell has changed in size, the structure of anorthite is called a \u2018\u2018superstructure\u201d. At intermediate pla- gioclase compositions there is a complicated mix- ture between the albite and anorthite ordering patterns, resulting in a long-range ordered super- structure with periodicities up to 70 \u02daA. While Al 3+/Si4+ ordering in sanidine gives rise to twinning in microcline with domains that are in a different orientation, ordering in anor- thite can cause a domain structure in which different regions within the macrocrystal are translated with respect to each other, depend- ing upon which T site in the structure an alu- minum atom prefers (Figure 19.15a).

A temperature--composition phase diagram for alkali feldspars is shown in Figure 19.16. It displays the polymorphic phase transformations due to Al/Si ordering in pure K-feldspar. Simi- lar transformations occur in albite: in low al- bite, Al/Si is ordered; in high albite they are progressively disordered, but, owing to distor- tion of the framework, which is not stabilized by the large K + as in orthoclase, the disordered structure of high albite is still triclinically dis- torted. Only at much higher temperatures does a displacive transformation expand the triclinic structure to a monoclinic disordered form (so- called \u2018\u2018monalbite\u2019\u2019), which is isostructural with sanidine.

In electron microscope images, morphologies vary, ranging from parallel, slightly wavy bands (Figure 19.17a) to coarser zig-zag domains (Figure 19.17b). In both cases there is \ufb01ne twinning of the triclinic sodium-rich phase. In general there is a tendency to minimize mismatch across interfaces between the lamellar exsolved phases and the host. Pre- ferred orientations of lamellae are (\u00af601) and (\u00af301), which minimize the strain energy. In plagioclase (solid solution albite-- anorthite), phase transformations are very sluggish because of the requirement of charge neutrality with coupled substitution of sodium by calcium and silicon by aluminum. For this reason it is very dif\ufb01cult to establish phase diagrams experimentally and they are still based largely on empirical observations of feldspar as- semblages in natural rocks of known origin. The proposed phase diagram for plagioclase (Figure 19.18) is much less well founded than that for alkali feldspar (Figure 19.16). Nonetheless, it does illustrate that subsolidus relations are extremely complex in this solid solution series. There are at least three miscibility gaps, in oligoclase (peristerite gap), in labradorite (B\u00f8ggild gap), and in bytownite (Huttenlocher gap). Exsolution lamellae are very small (<1 /H9262m) and can be imaged only by electron microscopy. However, it is these lamellae that are responsible for the diffraction of light, causing a remarkable play of colors, exhibited by some plagioclases (e.g., peristerite and labradorite; Plate 7d). Brief description of silica minerals and feldspars (see also Table 19.1) Silica minerals Quartz is found in euhedral single crystals in druses and cavities. More often it occurs in gran- ular aggregates, as rock-forming anhedral, semi- transparent grains with vitreous or greasy luster such as in granite, sandstones, and ore deposit veins.

Quartz is an old German mining name. Fe 3+-bearing varieties are either purple-violet (amethyst, Plates 5d and 7a) or yellow (citrine). Brown and black varieties ( smoky quartz and morion, Plate 6d) are due to traces of aluminum, substituting for silicon. Green chrysoprase forms in altered ultrama\ufb01c rocks and contains inclu- sions of oxidized Ni-minerals, while aventurine contains inclusions of rutile. The reason for the pink color of some varieties of rose quartz (Plate 6e) has been revealed only recently as be- ing due to submicroscopic inclusions of a \ufb01- brous nanocrystalline material related to the rare mineral dumortierite (Al 7O3(BO3)(SiO4)3)( G o r e v a et al., 2001). As we have discussed in Chapter 16, the morphology of quartz changes with condi- tions of formation (see Figures 16.9 and 16.10). There are a variety of uses for quartz. It is industrially signi\ufb01cant in the production of piezocrystals, though most of them are presently synthetic. The colored varieties are used as gemstones. Quartz is used for the production of glass, and pure material has gained signi\ufb01cance in the manufacturing of \ufb01bers for optical ap- plications. The Mi \u02dcnas Gerais province of Brazil, which contains extensive pegmatite ores, is a major source of pure quartz. Opal (SiO 2.nH2O) is an unusual silica mineral. It is amorphous, in the sense that it does not have a long-range ordered crystal structure. In addition to SiO 2 it contains large quantities of water. This solid hydrogel varies in composition. The gel exists as minute spheres that are 1500-- 8000 \u02daA in size and often have a regular packing (see Figures 11.10 and 19.19b). This close-packed arrangement of spheres acts as a diffraction grat- ing for visible light and produces a characteristic play of colors (opalescence, Plate 7b). Opals that have brown, green, and black colors, contain im- purities of natural pigments such as green gar- nierite, brown iron hydroxides, black manganese oxides, etc. Opal is usually found as compact translucent, vitreous masses, veinlets, and collo- form aggregates. The name opal derives from the Sanskrit word \u2018\u2018upala\u2019\u2019, meaning precious stone. Opal crystallizes from geyser water during sur\ufb01cial weathering of feldspars and other sil- icates; it precipitates in the coastal zones of marine basins owing to coagulation of sil- ica gels.

When present in aggregate, opal is an undesirable component of concrete because of a reaction with cement that causes deterioration (\u2018\u2018silica poisoning\u2019\u2019) (see Chapter 32). Feldspars As with silica minerals the framework struc- ture of feldspars is characterized by the strong covalent--ionic bonds within a cellular frame- work. Bonding causes a high hardness (Mohs\u2019 scale 6) and the open framework low densi- ties of 2.5--2.8 g/cm 3 for most of these miner- als. The bond type and composition of feldspars determine their vitreous luster and transparence or translucence. Feldspars are mostly white be- cause transition elements generally do not enter their structures. Alkali feldspars In this subgroup, that includes microcline, orthoclase, and sanidine,N a + commonly sub- stitutes for K + and a general chemical formula may be written as (K, Na)AlSi 3O8.A sw eh a v e seen, Na+ substitutes for K+ in signi\ufb01cant propor- tions only at high temperatures because of the signi\ufb01cant difference between their ionic radii, and homogeneous alkali feldspars of interme- diate composition are preserved only by rapid cooling in volcanic rocks. Volcanic sanidines are usually richest in sodium, whereas metamorphic microclines contain the least amount of sodium. The crystals of alkali feldspar polymorphs are similar in habit. Orthoclase crystals from gran- ites are often very simple and close to equant ow- ing to a combination of (010) and (001) pinacoids and a monoclinic prism {110} (Figures 19.20a and 19.21). The minerals have (010) and (001) cleavages, with an interfacial angle that is al- most 90 \u25e6. Adularia is a variety of K-feldspar, with a habit dominated by the {110} prism (Figure 19.20b) that occurs in hydrothermal veins and \ufb01ssures. There are many types of twins in alkali feldspars, in addition to the Albite and Pericline", "page": 351}

A common growth twin in orthoclase and sanidine is the Carlsbad twin, with one crystal rotated 180 \u25e6 about the [001] axis (Figures 5.15f and 19.20c). While most alkali feldspars are white, gray, or pink (owing to submicroscopic hematite inclu- sions), some beautiful emerald-green or bluish- green varieties of microcline, called amazonite, exist (Plate 7c). The origin of this color is still un- certain. It is possibly due to an isomorphous sub- stitution K +Si4+\u21cc Pb2+Fe3+ or K+Al3+\u21cc Pb+Fe3+ that causes distortion in the structure and intro- duces color centers. Well-developed crystal faces and cleavage sur- faces in alkali feldspars have a vitreous lus- ter, while fracture surfaces have a greasy luster. Fig. 19.21 Euhedral crystals of orthoclase from Wieza, Poland (width 95 mm) (courtesy A. Massanek). Sometimes orthoclase has perthite exsolution on a submicroscopic scale, resulting in diffraction of visible light and a beautiful glimmering lus- ter with pearly optical effects. Such perthites are called moonstone. Alkali feldspars are rock-forming minerals of plutonic rocks such as granites, granite peg- matites, and syenites (alkali feldspar-rich plu- tonic rocks); they also occur as phenocrysts in felsic volcanic rocks such as rhyolites. These min- erals also crystallize in hydrothermal conditions predominantly within ore-bearing veins or aure- oles of metasomatic alterations of country rocks. Alkali feldspars are common in metamorphic rocks as a result of profound transformation of sediments or other initial rocks. Potassium feldspars also form during diagenesis in lime- stones, sandstones, and shales (\u2018\u2018authigenic sani- dine\u201d). The minerals undergo different types of alteration when they react with water: muscovi- tization or sericitization (sericite is a \ufb01ne-grained variety of muscovite that may deviate from the ideal composition of muscovite) at high tempera- tures, and kaolinitization owing to weathering at low temperatures. Muscovitization may be char- acterized schematically by the reaction: 3KAlSi3O8 + 2H2O \u21cc K-feldspar KAl2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2 + 6SiO2 + 2KOH Muscovite Quartz In solution", "page": 352}
{"text": "330 QUARTZ AND FELDSPARS.

For such purposes gran- ite pegmatites are preferred; but since most peg- matite deposits are quite small and rare, gran- ites rich in orthoclase and microcline are also employed. Plagioclase feldspars (or plagioclase) The composition of plagioclase feldspars is usu- ally explained in terms of the coupled substi- tution Na +Si4+ \u21cc Ca2+Al3+. The composition of plagioclase is generally expressed as percentage of anorthite (An 0 = albite = NaAlSi3O8,A n 100 = anorthite = CaAl2Si2O8). The crystal morphology of plagioclase is sim- ilar to that of alkali feldspars. Multiple (polysyn- thetic) twins are very typical but not on such a \ufb01ne scale as the transformation twins in micro- cline. According to the Albite law, twinning with a composition plane (010) is most common (see Figure 5.15b and Plate 3b,e). The plagioclases are white, green, grayish- lilac, or dark-gray (due to inclusions). Plagio- clase with compositions corresponding to the ex- solution gaps may display iridescent colors of blue, red, yellow or green (\u2018\u2018schiller color\u2019\u2019). Best known are peristerites (of oligoclase composition) and labradorites (see Plate 7d). The color of peri- sterite and labradorite has an origin similar to that of opal, but, instead of spheres, \ufb01ne exsolu- tion lamellae act as diffraction gratings for light. Labradorite with iridescent colors is the only pla- gioclase that is used as a decorative stone. The plagioclases have perfect cleavages par- allel to (010) and (001), with an angle between the cleavage surfaces of about 86 \u25e6. The cleav- age surfaces (usually one of them, sometimes both) exhibit striation caused by the polysyn- thetic twinning. Plagioclases are major rock-forming minerals in felsic (i.e., silica-rich), intermediate, and ma\ufb01c, as well as alkali igneous rocks (granites, granite pegmatites, diorites, gabbro, and their volcanic analogs). In these rocks all varieties of plagio- clases are found (sodium- and silicon-rich vari- eties in felsic rocks; calcium- and aluminum-rich varieties in ma\ufb01c rocks; pure albite in alkali rocks). The largest crystals (oligoclase measur- ing up to several meters on a side) occur in granite pegmatites. Albite is characteristic for hy- drothermal deposits. Sugar-like masses of albite replace earlier-formed minerals of granites, syen- ites and pegmatites, signifying the process of metasomatic \u2018\u2018albitization\u2019\u2019. Albite also occurs as plate-like crystals in druses, in acicular accre- tions in cavities, and in open fractures. Albite is often accompanied by rare-metal mineralization, in particular by zirconium, niobium, tantalum, beryllium and rare earth elements. Plagioclases are also a main component of metamorphic rocks such as gneisses and amphibolites. Sedimentary rocks such as sandstones and graywackes con- tain terrigenous material consisting of plagio- clase. Calcium- and aluminum-rich plagioclases are ubiquitous in stony and stony-iron meteorites. During meteoric impact they frequently undergo amorphization.

The origin of granite When discussing quartz and feldspars the rock granite comes immediately to mind. It is com- posed largely of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, and quartz. Because of the high silica content, it is known as a siliceous (or felsic) rock, contrary to basalt, for example, which is called a ma\ufb01c rock (de\ufb01cient in silica and rich in Mg and Fe).

Depending on the Q--P--A composition, different names are assigned. There are at least \ufb01ve major compositional vari- eties of granitic rocks. So-called normal granites consist of quartz (20--60 vol.%), alkali feldspars (30--75%) and plagioclase (20--50%), and colored minerals -- biotite or hornblende (7--10% of the total). In diorite and tonalite, alkali feldspars are minor; hornblende is a common colored con- stituent. Alkali feldspar granites and syenites con- tain only small amounts or no plagioclase. Gra- nodiorite, intermediate between normal granite and tonalite, is the most common granitic rock. If we take a melt of the average composi- tion of the earth\u2019s mantle and crust and cool it, magnesium- and iron-rich minerals such as olivine and pyroxene will precipitate \ufb01rst, fol- lowed by calcic plagioclase. The residual melt becomes enriched in silica and alkalis and will \ufb01nally approach a granitic composition. It was therefore speculated that granites were the prod- uct of such compositional differentiation from a magma of more ma\ufb01c composition. However, ge- ologists made the unexpected observation that granitic rocks in the earth\u2019s continental crust are very common in plutons but rare as volcanic rocks, whereas the more ma\ufb01c basalts are com- mon as volcanic rocks and rare as plutonic rocks. This heterogeneous occurrence of the two rock types makes their origin through differentiation of a uniform magma unlikely.

Contrary to binary phase diagrams, which we discussed in Chapters 17 and 18, granite con- stitutes a ternary system, with quartz, albite, and K-feldspar as major components. (All pla- gioclase is represented as albite to simplify the relationships.) One of the \ufb01rst phase diagrams of this system was published and discussed by N. Bowen and O.F.

{"text": "THE ORIGIN OF GRANITE 333 The binary NaAlSi 3O8--KAlSi3O8 (front) side of the ternary diagram (Figure 19.23a, comparable to Figure 19.16) explains the order of crystalliza- tion of alkali feldspars in granites. This graph has a temperature minimum for the melt at 1062 \u25e6C. Consider crystallization of a liquid with compo- sition X. Falling temperature cools the liquid to- ward the liquidus line. At the intersection of this line (point 1, temperature T 1) sanidine en- riched in sodium begins to crystallize. It has a composition 1 \u2032. Further cooling causes growth of sanidine crystals and their reaction with the liq- uid. With decreasing temperature the melt com- positions shift along the liquidus curve towards point 2, whereas crystal compositions shift along a solidus curve towards point 2 \u2032 (temperature T2), which marks the end of crystallization of the liq- uid. As long as the crystals of feldspar remained in equilibrium with the magma throughout the entire process, the composition of feldspar will correspond to a homogeneous composition X, equivalent to the composition of the initial melt. Further cooling of homogeneous albite-- sanidine solution crystals causes no phase changes until temperature T 3 (point 3) is reached. At that point, after intersecting the solvus, feldspar crystals exsolve into two phases. They are sanidine containing some sodium (composition 3), and albite with some potassium (composition 3 \u2032). They often form lamellar perthite structures (see e.g., Plate 3c). On further cooling, composi- tions of these two phases migrate (in equilibrium conditions) down each side of the solvus. For ex- ample, at temperature T 4, compositions of coex- isting feldspars are X1 and X2. The binary diagram in Figure 19.23a is schematic. A more detailed phase diagram for alkali feldspars was introduced in Figure 19.16. In addition to the liquidus, solidus, and solvus curves, it contains boundaries between disor- dered sanidine and high albite, and ordered low albite and microcline. Now let us return to the ternary diagram. It has a gently dipping surface of alkali feldspar, with a valley dipping towards the back. This surface intersects the much steeper surface of the quartz peak, where quartz (or one of the high- temperature silica polymorphs) crystallizes \ufb01rst. The line separating the \ufb01elds is a depression and called the cotectic line by analogy with the eutec- tic point, introduced in Chapter 16. Along the cotectic line, alkali feldspars and quartz crystal- lize simultaneously. Point M is the temperature minimum along the cotectic line. Liquids of any composition in Figure 19.23a will \ufb01nish crystal- lization on the cotectic line. Crystallization in the ternary system is bet- ter explained in Figure 19.23b, a projection on the compositional triangle with solid lines rep- resenting contours of the liquidus temperature. The composition of the alkali feldspar that is in equilibrium with the melt is illustrated with dotted lines. Take, for example, a melt compo- sition X in Figure 19.23b.

During this crystallization, the alkali feldspar becomes more albite-rich and, when the melt reaches the cotectic line, the equilibrium com- position of the feldspar is Or 25Ab75. At this point quartz starts to crystallize and the melt shifts in composition towards M , which is the eutec- tic point of this system and the lowest temper- ature that a dry (volatile-free) granitic melt can have (988 \u25e6C). Below this temperature, quartz and alkali feldspar precipitate simultaneously. Microstructures that are consistent with such simultaneous crystallization are occasionally ob- served in what is known as \u2018\u2018graphic texture\u2019\u2019, a characteristic intergrowth of quartz and feldspar that is found in some granitic rocks, espe- cially pegmatites.

They resemble cuneiform symbols and hence the name \u2018\u2018graphic\u2019\u2019. We have used the ternary phase diagram to explain crystallization during cooling of a melt. It can also be used to explain the melting of solid rock. If melting occurs in overall equilibrium, the \ufb01rst melt of any composition in this ternary sys- tem will have a composition at M .

{"text": "TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE 335 Pegmatites Usually the term pegmatite is applied to veins, dikes, and lenses of coarse-grained rocks. The dikes are sometimes 10 or more meters in thickness and hundreds of meters in length. Pegmatites are composed of the same minerals as the rocks to which they are related by origin, and often occur in spatial proximity. Granite pegmatites are the most abundant variety. They consist of feldspars (microcline, orthoclase, albite-rich plagioclase), quartz, micas (muscovite and biotite), and accessory minerals. Syenite pegmatites and gabbro--pegmatites are much less abundant. Granite pegmatites are commonly composed of very large crystals, much larger than those in the host rock. We will discuss only granite pegmatites below. Feldspars are the dominant minerals in peg- matites, making up 50--70% of the volume, and quartz comprising 20--40% of the volume. Among the common minor minerals are muscovite and biotite. For industrial applications it is signi\ufb01- cant that pegmatite minerals often concentrate boron, phosphorus, uranium, rare earth ele- ments, lithium, beryllium, cesium, and tanta- lum. Pegmatites are the main source for some of these elements. The grain size and composition of pegmatites often differ within a vein. The largest mineral grains are typical for the central blocky parts of t h ev e i n s .I ti si ns u c hp e g m a t i t e st h a tt h el a r g e s t crystals occur. For example, feldspar crystals ex- c e e d i n g1 0mi ns i z eh a v eb e e nf o u n di nN o r w a y , and huge plates of mica (muscovite) weighing 85 tonnes in India, beryl crystals weighing up to 200 tonnes in Brazil, and spodumene crystals ex- ceeding 16 m in length and 90 tonnes in weight in South Dakota, USA. Presumably, pegmatites formed at a depth of about 6--8 km. Their genesis is a subject of con- troversy. One school of thought (see e.g., London, 1987) proposes that they are the crystallization products of residual melts intruding into frac- tures in country rocks. Such residual melts are relatively rich in volatiles (H 2O, HF, HCl, B 2O3, etc.). Its crystallization starts at 900--800 \u25e6C, and the major minerals (feldspars and quartz) form in the 800--600 \u25e6C temperature range at a late igneous stage. Later minerals crystallize from subcritical aqueous solutions. A very different origin has been proposed by others (see e.g., Cameron et al., 1949; Jahns and Burnham, 1969). Their interpretation is based on the frequent chaotic structure of the pegmatite veins in which recrystallization phenomena are widespread, with resorbtion and chemical sub- stitution of earlier-crystallized minerals. In this scenario, pegmatites result from profound trans- formation of felsic rocks under the in\ufb02uence of hydrothermal solutions, rather than by direct magmatic crystallization. On the basis of mineral assemblages, several types of granite pegmatites may be distinguished. The most important types are mica-bearing pegmatites, topaz--beryl pegmatites, and albite- -spodumene pegmatites. The mica-bearing", "page": 358}

Unusual mineral occurrences Introduction After the discussion of some of the most com- mon but also the most complex minerals in Chap- ter 19, we now examine some structurally and chemically very simple compounds that are rare and form only under unusual conditions. In this chapter we discuss minerals of native elements such as graphite (C), diamond (C), copper (Cu), gold (Au) and silver (Ag) and solid solutions of these elements (for instance, Au--Ag and Au--Cu) (Table 20.1). There are also intermetallic com- pounds with ordered crystal structures that dif- fer from the end members. Often, these inter- metallic compounds form during cooling as a result of ordering of high-temperature solid so- lutions of the same compositions. Some natu- rally occurring examples of intermetallics are awaruite (FeNi 3), wairauite (FeCo), isoferroplat- inum (cubic Pt 3Fe), tetraferroplatinum (tetrago- nal PtFe), tulameenite (Pt 2FeCu), ferronickelplat- inum (Pt 2NiFe), hongshiite (PtCu), rustenburgite (Pt3Sn), urvantsevite (PdBi 2), auricuprite (Cu 3Au), and schachnerite (AgHg). Don\u2019t be intimidated -- no one will expect you to memorize these names and formulas. They are listed merely to give you an impression of the astonishing variety of inter- metallic compounds. Most of the minerals in this section are very rare. In total, they comprise less than 0.0002 weight% of the earth\u2019s crust, and many have been discovered very recently. However, not only are their structures interesting and well known in materials science, they are also of great eco- nomic interest. Native gold, platinum, osmium, iridium, and silver are the principal sources for these elements. A signi\ufb01cant portion of the sul- fur used in the chemical industry is mined in the form of native sulfur. Minerals such as diamond and graphite are used because of their unique properties (hardness, electric conductivity, and refraction). For many years it was generally assumed that only a few elements could exist in nature in the native form because of their chemical inertness. Just a few decades ago no mineralogist would have imagined that elements such as aluminum, cadmium, and silicon could exist in their native form in nature. Yet recent investigations with electron microscopes and electron microprobes have led to the discovery of minerals whose exis- tence was thought to be impossible in rocks and ores. Certainly they occur under almost unique conditions and are found in in\ufb01nitesimally small quantities and tiny grains, which generally can- not be seen, even with an optical microscope. Similarly, new intermetallics and solid solutions of metals are discovered at a rate of about \ufb01ve every year. Crystal structures and relationships to morphology and physical properties The crystal structures of native metals are relatively simple and can be described by a close-packing arrangement (Figures 2.6 and 2.7).

The less metallic the character of the bonding, the further the structure deviates from ideal close-packing. In contrast with these metals, native sulfur has a molecular structure. Each molecule consists of a ring of eight atoms with covalent bonding and a complete charge balance. In the most common orthorhombic polymorph, the rings (shaded in Figure 20.1) are stacked on top of each other to form \u2018\u2018pillars\u2019\u2019 that are differently oriented in space. Bonding between the rings and the pillars is of the van der Waals type. The structures of two natural carbon poly- morphs (diamond and graphite), along with a phase diagram, are shown in Figure 20.2 (see also Figure 2.12). The diamond structure has strong covalent bonds in all three dimensions. Four neighboring atoms in the form of a tetrahedron surround every atom. The structure of graphite consists of hexagonal carbon sheets. Within a layer, carbon atoms are connected by strong co- valent bonds, whereas weak van der Waals bonds operate between layers (dashed lines in Figure 20.2).

Fullerene exists in trace amounts in some meteorites. The external appearance of crystals (their symmetry and habit) and their physical properties are closely related to the struc- ture. This correspondence is particularly striking for minerals of the native metallic elements. Cubic close-packed crystals display the forms of a cube, octahedron (Figure 20.4), dodecahedron, or a combination of these (Figure 4.18), although in nature they often occur as dendrites (Figure 20.5, Plate 8a,b) or irregular aggregates (Plate 8d). The native nonmetallic minerals have a more diverse morphology. Sulfur crystallizes in orthorhombic symmetry as dipyramid-like polyhedra combined with the prismatic and pinacoidal faces (Plate 9c). The crystals of graphite are, as a rule, thin platelets parallel to (0001). Diamond occurs as octahedral (Plate 9a,b), dodecahedral, and (more rarely) cube-shaped crystals. Structure and bond type are also strikingly expressed in the physical properties of the na- tive elements. For example, native gold, silver, and copper have typical metallic luster, high den- sity, high electrical and thermal conductivity, are malleable and lack cleavage. In contrast, sulfur is brittle, has a low density (2.05--2.08 g/cm 3) and low hardness (Mohs\u2019 scale about 3), and easily ig- nites and melts owing to its molecular structure.", "page": 363}
{"text": "342 SIMPLE COMPOUNDS. UNUSUAL MINERAL OCCURRENCES Fig. 20.4 Octahedral crystals of gold from Mariposa County, California, USA (width 15 mm) (courtesy J. Arnoth). Graphite has a perfect cleavage along the plane of the hexagonal sheets (0001) and also high electro- conductivity parallel to this plane because of the quasi-metallic nature of the bonding, with some free electrons existing between carbon layers. In- dividual carbon layers are easily rubbed off, con- tributing to the low hardness of graphite and its use in writing tools. Finally, diamond possesses an extremely high hardness (10) because of the unusual compactness of its structure and the co- valent character of the bonds. Brief description of important minerals of the native elements Native copper has only minor impurities of silver, gold, and iron. It occurs as nodules, as single ir- regular grains, as wire-like and plate-like crystals in fractures, and as dendrites (Figure 20.5). The mineral is red in color and often covered with black, green, and blue \ufb01lms of copper oxides. In order to identify copper, it is useful to scratch it or determine its streak color. Copper has metal- lic luster in fresh pieces, can be scratched with a knife (hardness 2.5--3), and has a high density (8.4--8.9 g/cm 3). Copper occurs in assemblages with other cop- per minerals such as cuprite, tenorite, malachite, and chrysocolla in oxidation zones of sul\ufb01de ores. It serves as a copper ore, but as a native element it is economically not important and most copper is extracted from minerals such as chalcopyrite. Gold contains variable amounts of silver, pal- ladium, rhodium, copper, tellurium, and bis- muth. If gold contains more than 10% silver it is called electrum. The mineral forms \ufb01ne platelets, irregular grains, and inclusions in quartz and sul\ufb01des (pyrite, arsenopyrite, tennantite, and tetrahedrite). Regular gold single crystals are rare. Exceptional crystals have been found in Romania (Plate 8c) and in California, USA (see Figure 20.4, Plate 8d), often with octahedral mor- phology. In sediments (placers), gold is found as nuggets of various shapes and sizes ranging from fractions of a gram to tens of kilograms in weight. Gold is soft (Mohs\u2019 scale 2--3) but has an extremely high density of about 16--18 g/cm 3 (pure gold is 19.3 g/cm3). Gold has long been an international standard, and many currencies are still backed by it. Gold is used mainly in the manufacture of jewelry and there are applications in the electronic industry. In recent years its value has undergone large \ufb02uc- tuations owing to changes in supply and demand, caused in particular by political factors, and gold production has varied accordingly. The main in- dustrial deposits are medium-temperature (rarely low-temperature) hydrothermal veins, often as- sociated with tectonic events. Other large gold deposits are secondary, either owing to exten- sive chemical weathering in a tropical climate Fig. 20.5 Skeletal dendrites of silver from Wolkenstein, Erzgebirge, Saxony, Germany (width 20 mm) (courtesy A. Massanek).", "page": 364}

Silver is a rare mineral that forms thin platelets, sheets, skeletal dendrites (Figure 20.5) and wire-like crystals (Plate 8a) in fractures of ore bodies. This mineral has a silver-white color, metallic luster, and hook-shaped (hackly) fracture surfaces. Silver occurs in medium-temperature hydrothermal deposits and oxidation zones. When exposed to air it oxidizes easily and the surface blackens. The alteration product is greasy and rubs off. In nature, iron occurs as two cubic poly- morphs, native iron or kamacite (bcc) and taen- ite (austenite is the corresponding metallurgical name, fcc). Kamacite is essentially a meteoritic equivalent of native iron, enriched in nickel (up to 5--8%), while taenite also occurs in meteorites but has up to 70% nickel. Both polymorphs are ex- tremely rare minerals. Impregnations and larger concentrations of iron are found in some ter- restrial and lunar basalts. In recent years \ufb01ne droplet-like inclusions of iron were observed in diamonds. Ni 3Fe has been documented within ophiolites of Josephine Creek in southwest Ore- gon, USA, and it has been suggested that this ma- terial may originate from the core--mantle bound- ary (Bird and Weathers, 1975). In iron and stony-iron meteorites the Fe- polymorphs are characteristically intergrown with a hatched pattern (known as the Wid- manst\u00a8atten\u2019s pattern; see Figure 20.6). Probably these aggregates form by separation of an ini- tially homogeneous nickel--iron solid solution into two phases, one relatively poor in nickel and another nickel-rich. While these minerals are rare in nature, bcc and fcc iron are the major phases of commercial steel. Also, the solid inner core of the earth is likely to consist of hexagonal close-packed iron. Minerals in meteorites and the conditions of their formation will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 34. Platinum is generally a complex solid solu- tion of platinum, iridium, rubidium, osmium, palladium, iron, and nickel. This mineral is ex- tremely rare and occurs in mantle-derived ultra- ma\ufb01c rocks as minute inclusions. Examples of such deposits are the Bushveld Complex in South Africa and the Stillwater Complex in Montana, USA. In the earth\u2019s crust platinum undergoes Fig. 20.6 Widmanst\u00a8 atten\u2019s pattern, an intergrowth of kamacite and taenite, observed in meteoritic iron.

For a long time platinum was considered to be a single mineral of variable composition, and only recently could a distinct submicro- scopic structural and chemical heterogeneity be documented. The color of platinum grains and nuggets is overall gray ranging from silver- white to greenish-black shades, and the density \ufb02uctuates from 15 to 19 g/cm 3, depending on composition.

Sulfur is translucent, yellow or greenish-yellow in color, and has a greasy luster in aggregates and on fracture sur- faces. It is brittle, soft (hardness 1--2), and light (density 2.05--2.08 g/cm 3), and can be ignited with a match. The main economic deposits of sulfur are products of volcanic sublimation (see Figure 16.2), but sulfur also forms in sediments owing to bacteria-initiated decay of hydrogen sul\ufb01de. Granular aggregates with good crystals are a secondary recrystallized material. Sulfur is used mainly for manufacturing of sulfuric acid and as a fungicide in agriculture. Graphite occurs in two polytypes, hexago- nal and trigonal. It is greasy to touch, and typically forms dark-grayish and black-colored masses. More rarely it forms euhedral plate-like hexagonal crystals (with a submetallic luster), as in some marbles and schists. Graphite has a very low density and hardness (1) and leaves a black streak on paper. Commercially valuable deposits of graphite are found in nepheline syenites and metamor- phic rocks. Graphite is used as a technical lu- bricant, as electrodes in electrical equipment, in metallurgy (high carbon steels), and as a neutron absorber in nuclear reactors. Diamond is a carbon polymorph that is stable at high pressure (see Figure 20.2). At atmospheric pressure and with oxygen present it burns to CO 2 at 850 \u25e6C. Diamonds crystallize mainly as octahe- dra with faces that are frequently covered with numerous growth and dissolution steps (Plate 9a). Since these steps often cannot be seen with the n a k e de y e ,t h ef a c e ss e e mt ob ec u r v e do rs p h e r - ical; twins in diamond are common. Some large and famous diamond crystals are listed in Table 31.4. Diamond has the highest hardness of all known minerals (10). It has a good cleavage on {111} and a higher density than graphite (3.50--3.53 versus 2.2 g/cm 3, respectively). Dia- monds display a diversity of colors, although colorless transparent crystals are most common. Colored diamonds can be blue (owing to re- placement of carbon by boron), yellow (when nitrogen substitutes for carbon), red, orange, brown, green, and black (because of graphite inclusions). Diamond has a high refractive in- dex (2.42), and a striking dispersion (0.044) that causes a play of colors, especially in cuts called \u2018\u2018brilliants\u201d (Plate 9a). Primary diamond deposits are in kimberlites and lamproites (see below). Diamond also occurs in placers of various composition and age, some- times accompanied by platinum and gold. Diamond is the most precious gemstone. It is also widely used as an ultrahard material for manufacturing of drilling heads, cutting tools, perforators, and abrasive instruments. About 75--80% of mined diamonds are used for in- dustrial applications. The best-known diamond deposits are in South Africa, Australia, Siberia (Russia), and Brazil.

{"text": "discussed in more detail in Chapter 31. Unusual conditions of formation Elements such as platinum, osmium, iridium, and, to some extent, gold are chemically inert and do not react under normal circumstances. However, their formation often requires a low oxygen fugacity in the mineral-forming environ- ment. This condition is sometimes satis\ufb01ed in the earth\u2019s mantle. Examples are platinum in ultra- ma\ufb01c rocks, and diamonds in kimberlite pipes and eclogites. Native metals of the platinum group also oc- cur in olivine peridotite complexes in a cratonic environment (e.g., Bushveld in South Africa, Sudbury in Canada, Stillwater in Montana (USA), and Monchegorsk and Talnakh in Russia), or in ophiolites in orogenic belts (e.g., the Ural Mountains). In primary ore deposits many of these minerals are solid solutions of complicated composition. During their subsequent geological history these primary products of magmatic crystallization were brought to crustal levels and recrystallized under the in\ufb02uence of \ufb02uids and hydrothermal solutions.

Parallel to these transformations primary ferromagnesian silicate minerals were replaced by amphibole, serpentine, talc, and chlorite and the native elements are often the sole reminder of the early mantle origin. Diamonds form within the mantle at depths of around 650 km. Those diamonds that have been found in the uppermost crust were \ufb01rst up- lifted into magma chambers at 200--150 km be- fore \ufb01nally being carried to the surface. Classic diamond deposits are vertical pipes (diatremes) of kimberlite, which is an ultrama\ufb01c igneous rock (Figure 20.7). The deepest diatremes can be traced in quarries and mines for more than 1 km. They consist of volcanic vents \ufb01lled with a breccia con- taining a mixture of fragments and xenoliths of country rocks, as well as fragments of rocks carried from depths of 130 km and more, from the upper mantle. They are cemented by volcano- clastic material and alkaline ultrama\ufb01c tuffs. Some diatremes contain euhedral diamond crys- tals. The total diamond content of a diamond- bearing pipe of commercial value rarely exceeds a tenth of a gram per tonne of rock. The age of kimberlite pipes ranges from Archean to Cenozoic, and yet the diamonds within them are all 2--3 billion years old, judging from the few available geochronological data. The for- mation of pipes is related to the rapid intrusion of alkaline-ultrama\ufb01c magmas along narrow con- duits, which can occur only at high pressure. Diamonds also form in eclogites and some schists at great crustal depth and conceivably high tectonic stresses. Particularly in deep conti- nental areas with low geothermal gradients (see Figure 20.2) diamond is the stable carbon poly- morph but becomes metastable when these un- usual metamorphic rocks rise to the surface. For kinetic reasons they survive as long as the envi- ronment is not oxidizing. Such metamorphic di- amonds have been found in China (Dabie Shan), the Urals and Germany (Erzgebirge). Diamonds also crystallize from carbon dur- ing meteorite impacts, both in meteorites and in the rocks underlying impact craters. In the Bar- ringer (\u2018\u2018Meteor\u2019\u2019) crater in Arizona, USA, for ex- ample, diamond occurs as intergrowths within yet another hexagonal form of native carbon, lonsdaleite. Judging from the occurrence of as- sociated stishovite, the high-pressure silica poly- morph, shock pressures during these impact events have exceeded 8 GPa.

{"text": "Chapter 21 Halides. Evaporite deposits Introduction About 120 minerals are halide compounds, characterized by the presence of halogen ions (Cl \u2212,B r \u2212,F \u2212,a n dI \u2212). Among them are the \ufb02uorides (e.g., CaF 2: \ufb02uorite), chlorides (e.g., NaCl: halite), bromides (e.g., AgBr: bromar- gyrite), iodides (e.g., AgI: iodargyrite), halogen salts (e.g., Na 3AlF6: cryolite), and oxihalogenides (e.g., Cu 2Cl(OH)3: atacamite). The chlorine- and \ufb02uorine-bearing minerals are the most abundant and the most important ones are listed with some properties in Table 21.1. Halogens are mi- nor components in other minerals such as topaz (Al 2(SiO4)F2), phosgenite (Pb 2(CO3)Cl2) and mari- alite (Na4(AlSi3O8)3Cl). In this chapter we discuss only the most common chlorides and \ufb02uorides, and emphasize their occurrence as evaporites, i.e., minerals that crystallize during evaporation of water from a supersaturated solution. Common compositional and structural features of halides Chlorine and \ufb02uorine are chemically very active elements and ionize easily by incorporat- ing an electron. The Cl \u2212 and F\u2212 anions are fairly large and bond readily with metallic cations. The most widespread halogen compounds that occur in nature as minerals are the \ufb02uorides and chlorides of alkali and alkaline earth elements (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and strontium). Some halide minerals (e.g., bischo\ufb01te (MgCl 2\u00b76H2O), carnallite (KMgCl 3\u00b76H2O)) may contain molecular water in their crystal struc- ture. This situation is particularly typical for the magnesium and aluminum \ufb02uorides, where wa- ter molecules compensate for the relatively small s i z e so fM g 2+ and Al 3+ as compared with Cl \u2212 and F\u2212. The crystal structures of the halides are very diverse, but simple structures with ionic bonding dominate, as in halite (NaCl), \ufb02uorite (CaF 2) and cesium chloride (CsCl, not a mineral) (Chapter 2). We have already described the halite struc- ture as a combination of two cubic face-centered lattices, one with Na + and an origin at coordi- nates 000, and one with Cl \u2212 at an origin 0 1 2 0 (see Figures 2.10b and 3.24b). Each sodium ion is surrounded by six chloride ions, and vice versa. The NaCl structure can be represented as a sys- tem of octahedra that share edges and corners (Figure 21.1). The structure can also be described as cubic close-packing of Cl \u2212,w i t hN a+ located in octahedral interstices. The crystal structure of \ufb02uorite is most easily remembered as a primitive cubic lattice of \ufb02uo- rine with calcium in alternate body centers (Fig- ure 21.2a), resembling a Rubik\u2019s cube that lacks half of the octants. Since the ionic radius of cal- cium is relatively large as compared with that of \ufb02uorine, the coordination number of calcium is 8, and the coordination polyhedron is a cube. In the \ufb02uorite structure the cubic coordination polyhedra share edges. Alternatively, the struc- ture can be viewed as an fcc array of calcium with \ufb02uorine in each one-eighth cube of the array. This", "page": 369}

Here each \ufb02uorine is surrounded by four calcium atoms (conventional unit cell). representation highlights that each \ufb02uorine atom is surrounded tetrahedrally by four calcium atoms (Figure 21.2b). Another typical halide structure is that of CsCl, which is a primitive cubic lattice of chloride ions (coordinates 000) and cesium in the body center 1 2 1 2 1 2 (Figure 21.3). As in \ufb02uorite, the cation is coordinated by eight anions and the coordina- tion polyhedron is a cube. The compound CsCl does not occur in nature, but the mineral salam- moniac (NH 4Cl), which does occur in nature, has the same basic structure. In the latter mineral, Cl\u2212 Cs+ Fig. 21.3 Structure of CsCl, isostructural with salammoniac (NH4Cl). instead of a single cation, the ammonium group NH + 4 is surrounded by four Cl \u2212.

For example, in bischo\ufb01te the coordination octa- hedra (Mg (H 2O)6)2+ a r el i n k e do v e rC l\u2212 (Figure 21.4a), and atacamite is built up of an octahe- dral framework with two different types of alter- nating coordination polyhedra, Cu(OH) 4Cl2 and Cu(OH)5Cl (Figure 21.4b). The ionic character of the bonds and the poly- hedral structures determines the crystal mor- phology of a majority of the halide compounds. The symmetry of the halides is often cubic or pseudocubic and the crystal habit is isometric, with forms such as {100} (cube), {111} (octa- hedron), and {110} (dodecahedron) dominating. Also, cleavages are highly symmetrical planes (e.g., {100} in halite and {111} in \ufb02uorite). Owing to the ionic bonding and lack of tran- sition elements, many halide minerals are color- less, transparent, and have refractive indices less than 1.5 and a vitreous luster. Halides with traces of iron, manganese, and Cu 2+ are blue, green, yellow or red colored. Colorless halite becomes blue when irradiated with X-rays or /H9253-rays. Fluo- rite emits visible light when irradiated with ul- traviolet radiation (see also Chapter 11).

The mineral \ufb02uoresces in ultraviolet light (Plate 5e,f). Fluorite has a vitreous luster on crystal faces and a greasy luster on fracture planes. The mineral has a hard- ness 4 on the Mohs\u2019 scale and perfect octahedral cleavage. The fracture surfaces of large crystals often display the cleavage cracks intercrossing at 60 \u25e6. Small grains and impregnations of \ufb02uorite are common in high-temperature hydrothermal veins. Large quantities of \ufb02uorite (massive granu- lar and radiaxial aggregates) that are a source of the mineral for the chemical industry occur in medium- and low-temperature hydrothermal de- posits. Large, pure crystals are found in cavities and druses of granite pegmatites. Such crystals are used as a raw material for optical applica- tions.

Halite (NaCl), also called rock salt , is cubic in symmetry and crystals are cubic or cube- octahedral in shape (Figure 1.4b and Plate 9d).

Halite has a vitreous or greasy luster, hardness 2, and a cubic cleavage. It is generally an evaporite mineral. The importance of halite as a food additive and preservative is well known. However, the main industrial application for halite is as road salt. The chemical industry uses halite to produce soda, hydrochloric acid (HCl), metallic sodium, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and chlorine. Halite is also used in metallurgy. Sylvite (KCl) has the same structure as halite, is also cubic in symmetry, and its crystals are cube shaped. Sylvite occurs in some evaporite deposits as granular masses of dirty-brown and red color and forms under similar conditions as halite. This mineral is the last precipitate of evap- orite lakes. Unlike halite, sylvite has a bitter-salty taste. Sylvite is used to produce potassium fertil- izers and potassium chemicals for medical, pho- tographic and cosmetic applications. Carnallite (KMgCl 3\u00b76H2O), a hydrous chloride mineral, occurs as white or pink aggregates. The mineral is very hygroscopic and has a speci\ufb01c bitter-salty taste. Carnallite is a constituent of saline sedimentary rocks. Like sylvite, the min- eral is used for potassium and magnesium ex- traction and as a fertilizer. Origin of halide minerals The conditions of halide crystallization and their stability are affected by two factors: (1) the abun- dance of halogen atoms in the earth\u2019s crust, and (2) the chemical properties of the compounds. The abundance of the halogens in the conti- nental crust parallels the electron af\ufb01nities, and energies of formation of NaX-like binary com- pounds (Table 21.2). The ionic radii of the halo- gens increase in the reverse order. Melting points decrease in the same order, whereas volatility and solubility increase. Cor- respondingly, \ufb02uoride minerals form typically in high-temperature endogenic processes. Fluo- rite occurs in granites, pegmatites, hydrothermal veins, and skarns at igneous contacts. Chloride minerals form both in endogenic and exogenic conditions. Since chlorine concentrations in sur- face waters (such as in lakes, oceans, and ther- mal springs) are very high, evaporites are the most typical deposits of chloride minerals. Bro- mide and iodide minerals are exotic because the ionic radii of Br \u2212 and I\u2212 are large and their elec- tron af\ufb01nities and binding energies are low, re- ducing their stability. Most Br \u2212 and I\u2212 is dissolved in surface water. Evaporites in marine basins Most halides, except \ufb02uorides, are present in sed- imentary rocks called evaporites because they are the result of the evaporation of water. Evaporites are chemical precipitates that crystallize in su- persaturated solution and generally concentrate at the bottom of a basin. An evaporation pro- cess", "page": 373}

Today it is gener- ally recognized that there are also tectonic prere- quisites for a large evaporite deposit: the basin must subside over geological time, as is the case in rift valleys and continental graben structures. In the Paleozoic era, the ocean \ufb02ooded much of the continents, and reefs isolated shallow seas. Examples are the Permian Zechstein of Central Europe, North American basins such as Williston (Canada), Michigan and Gulf Coast (Figure 21.8), USA, and the Late Tertiary Mediterranean men- tioned above. Rift valley basins include the Trias- sic salt deposits of the Rhine graben, the Danakil depression in the Red Sea, and the Cambrian salt stocks in the Persian Gulf. The order of crystallization in an evaporating lagoon is controlled by the rules of aqueous so- lution physical chemistry. The geological impli- cations of evaporite systems were \ufb01rst pointed out by chemist J.H. van\u2019t Hoff (1912) using the example of Stassfurt (Germany), which is part of the large Permian Zechstein deposit in periph- eral basins of the North Sea in Central Europe (Box 21.1). Figure 21.9 shows the general crystal- lization sequence. When an amount of seawater is dried to 60--70% of its original volume, calcite forms. When the brine becomes more concen- trated, sulfates, gypsum, and anhydrite precipi- tate, followed by halite. Subsequently, along with the precipitation of magnesium and potassium and sulfates, sylvite crystallizes. Later, carnallite and \ufb01nally bischo\ufb01te crystallize. This scheme is idealized because in reality the thickness of beds varies widely, depending on local changes in sea level and climate.", "page": 375}
{"text": "354 HALIDES. EVAPORITE DEPOSITS Box 21.1 Crystallization from aqueous solutions during evaporation Van\u2019t Hoff (1905, 1909) derived the crystallization sequence in a system with \ufb01ve components NaCl\u2013KCl\u2013MgCl 2\u2013Na2SO4\u2013H2O, which has since then become classical in solution chemistry. It is assumed that the solution is saturated with respect to NaCl, i.e., the solution contains halite crystals. There are many other possible phases in addition to halite (Table 21.3). We represent the stability \ufb01eld in a ternary diagram with the water content at saturation as a fourth axis and K 2, Mg, and SO2\u2212 4 as end members (Figure 21.10a). Take a composition A rich in SO 2\u2212 4 . During evaporation, the water content de- creases without changing the composition in K2, Mg, and SO2\u2212 4 . When the surface is reached (point B), thenardite (t) will start to crystallize and, on further evap- oration, the composition of the solution will change, descending the thenardite \ufb01eld, away from the thenardite composition, until the boundary with aphthitalite (aph) is reached (C). At that point both thenardite and aphthitalite crystallize and the composition of the solution changes along the borderline between the two stability \ufb01elds (arrow). Seawater (SW) has a composition that is much richer in Mg than point A (K 2:Mg : SO2\u2212 4 = 6 : 61 : 33). As you can see, it is close to a region with many phases. In order to better follow the processes during the evaporation of seawater, we enlarge the lower corner of the ternary diagram and display it as a projection on the triangle K 2\u2013Mg\u2013SO2\u2212 4 (Figure 21.10b). With evaporation of seawater (SW) the \ufb01rst mineral to precipitate is bl\u00a8 odite (bl). Then the composition path of the solution follows the valley between epsomite (e) and kainite (ka), hexahydrite (hx) and kainite, kieserite (ks) and kainite, kieserite and carnallite (c), and \ufb01nally bischo\ufb01te (bi) and carnallite (indicated by the arrow in Figure 21.10b). Similar trends have been observed in the Stassfurt evaporite sequence (Figure 21.9). Even though phase relations are complicated, the system that we have discussed does not include any calcium, nor does it have any carbonate or borate anion groups; therefore minerals such as calcite, gypsum, and anhydrite are not included and in reality processes are far more complex. In the phase diagram the evaporation path never passes through the \ufb01eld of sylvite. In nature, the initial composition in a speci\ufb01c evaporite basin can differ from that of ideal seawater and temperatures may vary. Secondary processes of recrystallization may also change the primary evaporation products. Continental salt lakes Continental evaporite deposits are typical of deserts. The amount of water present may be quite variable, and the composition of continen- tal lakes varies much more than that of seawater because it is controlled by chemical weather- ing of the surrounding surface and penetration of the local rocks by groundwater.

As one de- scends from the source near the Sierra Nevada Mountains through the chain of evaporite lakes Owens, Searles, Panamint, and \ufb01nally Death Valley, the composition of the deposit changes systematically. The Searles Lake deposit is particu- larly rich in potassium, boron, sodium, chloride, lithium, sulfate and corponate, and is actively mined for these elements and compounds. Evaporites are distributed over a depth of over 100 m. Temperature and pressure gradients, as well as variations in brine concentrations, produce many different evaporite minerals, all indicative of the local chemical and physical conditions under which they formed.

The salt intrudes Triassic sandstone. Mineral deposits are indicated. Secondary salt deposits Conditions that can provide a regular crystalliza- tion order as proposed by van\u2019t Hoff are rarely realized in nature. Often one observes a repeti- tion and alternation of the same layers, an ab- sence of others, changes of bedding periodicity, and wedges of clay and other rocks found in an evaporite sequence. All these factors prove that the initial marine basin dried under changing ge- ological conditions. Periodic freshwater \ufb02ooding or transgressive episodes with fresh brine in- \ufb02ux produced waters that dissolved the halide salts from their primary deposits and redeposited them as secondary deposits in the upper parts of a sedimentary sequence. Furthermore, salt min- erals are very ductile and, owing to their low density, buoyant in a sedimentary sequence. Therefore deeply buried salt beds may tecton- ically intrude upwards, as documented by the structures of anticlinal salt domes, which consti- tute some of the major salt deposits (Figure 21.11). By contrast, gypsum-bearing beds and other sul- fates are generally left in place and are trans- formed by the increasing pressure and temper- ature during burial into less hydrated or even entirely anhydrous minerals. This dehydration process can be illustrated with the following reactions: CaSO4\u00b72H2O \u2192 CaSO4 + 2H2O Gypsum Anhydrite Water 2Na2Mg(SO4)2\u00b74H2O \u2192 Bl\u00a8odite 2Na2Mg(SO4)2 \u00b7 2.5H2O + 3H2O Loeweite Water 2Na2SO4 + Na2Mg(SO4)2\u00b74H2O \u2192 Thenardite Bl \u00a8odite Na6Mg(SO4)4 + 4H2O Vanthof\ufb01te Water Such processes release large amounts of water that dissolve halide salts from the primary beds and penetrate the country rocks.

In some borates, the BO 3\u2212 3 groups are isolated as in calcite, but in most the planar triangular groups are linked to form chains and sheets. Moreover, there are also borates with BO 5\u2212 4 tetrahedra in their crystal structures, or with combinations of BO3\u2212 3 triangles and BO 5\u2212 4 tetrahedra. A list of the important carbonates, nitrates, and simple borates is given in Table 22.1. The most common carbonates, calcite and dolomite, comprise nearly 2.5% of the volume of the earth\u2019s crust. Characteristic features of composition and crystal chemistry of carbonates and borates By their chemical nature, the carbonate minerals are the most stable salts of carbonic acid. This acid is relatively weak and prefers to bond with elements of low ionization potentials (sodium, potassium, calcium, strontium) that are not too small in size (such as lithium). For the sodium ion, with a single charge, water molecules are inserted into the structure to shield the effect of Na + on the CO 2\u2212 3 complex. Molecular H 2O acts as a buffer between Na + and CO 2\u2212 3 . By con- trast, cations of high ionization potential such as Bi2+,C u2+, and rare earth elements form only if OH\u2212 groups, F \u2212,o rO 2\u2212 are present to weaken the CO 2\u2212 3 complex. An example is bastnaesite (CeCO3F). The carbon:oxygen radius ratio is very small (< 0.18 \u02daA/1.40 \u02daA = 0.14) and produces a tri- angular coordination (see Chapter 2), which is the characteristic structural motif of the CO 2\u2212 3 complex (Figure 22.1a). Many carbonates crystallize in the rhombohe- dral system, but orthorhombic and monoclinic c a r b o n a t e sa l s oe x i s t .A tl e a s ta tl o wt e m p e r a - ture, triangular CO 2\u2212 3 groups do not have rota- tional freedom. In calcite and dolomite they oc- cupy parallel planes (parallel to (0001)) in which the CO 2\u2212 3 triangles all point in the same direc- tion (Figure 22.1b). This feature causes the crys- tal structures of the carbonates and their physi- cal properties to be highly anisotropic, with large differences between properties parallel and per- pendicular to the c-axis.

(b) The distorted NaCl structure, with chloride ions replaced by CO 2\u2212 3 groups and compression along the body diagonal. View is along the [0001] axis. we compress the structure along the body diago- nal to produce rhombohedral rather than cubic symmetry (Figure 22.2b). By analogy with halite, we can therefore view the calcite structure as cu- bic close-packing of CO 2\u2212 3 groups with Ca 2+ in \u2018\u2018octahedral\u201d interstices. The analogy goes so far that even the excellent {100} cleavage in halite is preserved; it is now a rhombohedral{10\u00af14} cleav- age, illustrated by the cell in Figure 22.1b, which is not the conventional unit cell. The second polymorph of CaCO 3, aragonite, with orthorhom- bic symmetry, can be viewed as hexagonal close- packing of CO 2\u2212 3 groups with Ca 2+ in interstices, although this analogy is not perfect and the structure is considerably distorted. Figure 22.1b shows the structure of dolomite (CaMg(CO 3)2), where layers of Ca 2+ alternate with layers of Mg2+. In calcite all cations are Ca 2+. We have encountered calcite and aragonite in earlier chapters. In Chapter 6, for example, we introduced carbonates as examples of minerals exhibiting isomorphism and polymorphism. For small cations the calcite structure is preferred, but for large cations the aragonite structure is more stable. However, for CaCO 3 both structures are possible. At higher temperature and low pres- sure calcite is stable, and at high pressure and low temperature aragonite is stable (for the phase diagram, see Figure 17.2a). A few carbonate minerals have chain- or sheet-like structures. For instance the evap- orite minerals nahcolite (NaHCO 3) and trona (Na3(CO3)H(CO3)\u00b72H2O) have a chain structure in which hydrogen bonds induce the polymeriza- tion of the CO 2\u2212 3 g r o u p sa s( H C O3)\u2212 2 or H+(CO3)2\u2212 2 . Sheet-like structures have been observed in ura- nium, bismuth, and lead carbonates. Polymerization of triangular (and tetrahedral) groups is most prevalent in borates (Figure 22.3). The triangular BO 3\u2212 3 groups may be isolated as CO 2\u2212 3 groups (Figure 22.3a), or combined to form B2O4\u2212 5 (Figure 22.3b) or B 2O2\u2212 4 (Figure 22.3c) pairs, B4O4\u2212 8 rings (Figure 22.3d), or B 2O4\u2212 5 chains (Figure 22.3e). Charges are balanced by additional cations. In this respect the borates resemble silicates, except that the basic polyhedron is ei- ther a", "page": 383}

{"text": "MORPHOLOGY AND PROPERTIES OF CARBONATES 363 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) BO Fig. 22.3 Polymerization of BO3 groups in borates. Morphology and properties of carbonates. Mineral associations The majority of carbonates, such as calcite, mag- nesite, siderite, and dolomite, have rhombohe- dral symmetry. A morphology with the cleav- age rhombohedron {10\u00af14} as the growth form is common, but other forms are also observed. Some typical habits for calcite are shown in Figure 22.4. They may be classi\ufb01ed as rhombo- hedral habits in which a rhombohedral form dominates (Figure 22.4a--c) (a rhombohedron is a form of the type {10\u00af1l} with rhombuses as faces), scalenohedral habits (Figure 22.4d--f) (a scaleno- hedron is a form of the type {21\u00af3l} with trian- gles as faces), and prismatic types (Figure 22.4g--i). Plate 9e shows a crystal with scalenohedral-- prismatic habit, in Figure 22.5a crystals are platy and the basal face dominates. Calcite crystals in veins sometimes grow to enormous size such as those with rhombohedral morphology in an alpine vein (Figure 22.6). Dolomite frequently displays morphology with the cleavage rhomb (r = {10\u00af14} (Figure 22.5b). Orthorhombic carbon- ates may display pseudohexagonal morphology largely because of twinning, such as in aragonite (Plate 9g) or cerussite. The carbonates with more complicated com- positions and more complex structures have a less symmetrical morphology. Prismatic nahcol- ite, tabular trona, prismatic (Plate 10a) and tab- ular azurite, and \ufb01brous malachite occurring as botryoidal aggregates (Plate 10b and Figure 22.7) are examples.

Many carbonate minerals are colorless or white, but those with manganese are mainly pink (rhodochrosite, Plate 10d), and with copper are mainly green (malachite, Plate 10a--c) or blue (azurite, Plate 10a,c). Iron-containing carbonates are often yellow (ankerite and siderite) and brown because the iron oxidizes in inclusions of iron ox- ides and hydroxides. A distinct property of carbonates is their high birefringence, which expresses the pronounced anisotropy of their crystal structure. The differ- ence between the maximum refractive index of calcite (1.658) and the minimum index (1.486) is 0.172. Birefringence was \ufb01rst discovered with transparent calcite crystals called Iceland spar, where a \u2018\u2018double\u201d image is produced if light passes through the crystal (see Figure 9.11b).

{"text": "IMPORTANT CARBONATE MINERALS 365 Brief description of important carbonate minerals Calcite (CaCO3) often contains minor amounts of magnesium, iron and manganese, and its more complete chemical formula would be (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn)CO 3. The limits of isomorphic mis- cibility between the carbonate end members CaCO 3 and MgCO3 are shown in the temperature-- composition phase diagram Figure 22.8. At room temperature ionic substitution is very limited. Calcite is found in druses and in single crys- tals of diverse habit (rhombohedral, prismatic, platy, and more complex; see Figures 22.4, 22.5a, 22.6). It also forms solid granular masses and veinlets. The crystals are usually transparent or translucent and white in color. Calcite has cleav- age along the three directions of a rhombohe- dron r = {10\u00af14}, vitreous or pearly luster (on the cleavage surfaces), and, with a hardness of 3 on the Mohs\u2019 scale, it can be scratched with a knife. The bulk of calcite is found in limestone and has a chemical or biological origin. It is the dominant carbonate mineral in more recent sedimentary rocks.

Regional and contact metamorphism trans- forms limestone to marble. Calcite also occurs in skarns and in medium- and low-temperature hy- drothermal deposits. Limestone and marbles are used for the pro- duction of lime and particularly of cement (com- bined with other components). In the past, lime- stone and marble have been favorite building materials for Ancient Greek temples, medieval cathedrals, and baroque palaces. Rhodochrosite (MnCO 3) can be identi\ufb01ed by its pale-pink color (Plate 10d), but since its color may also be white, gray, or greenish-gray (just as with calcite and dolomite), positive identi\ufb01cation can be dif\ufb01cult. The mineral crystallizes in some hydrothermal deposits and in sedimentary man- ganese deposits. Magnesite (MgCO 3) is an end member of the magnesite--siderite isomorphic series. It forms spotty colored grayish-white solid masses of granular texture in dolostones that have re- crystallized and were affected by hydrother- mal solutions. Magnesite also occurs as white porcelain-like veins that form during weathering of serpentinites. The mineral is used as a mag- nesium ore and as a refractory material in the ceramics industry. Siderite (FeCO 3) is found in brown rhom- bohedral crystals with a highly vitreous luster and in granular aggregates within hydrother- mal medium-temperature veins. Often saddle- morphology is observed, with curved surfaces (see Figure 5.22b). Most siderite is formed chemi- cally in sedimentary rocks as late stages of hy- drothermal alteration.

There is some solid solution with calcite but only at high temperature (Figure 22.8). When dolomite coexists with calcite in metamorphic rocks, the composition of the two minerals can be used to determine the temperature of crystalliza- tion (see Figure 22.8). Another solid solution is Mg--Fe, with the iron end member being the min- eral ankerite CaFe(CO 3)2, which has the same structure as dolomite. Dolomite crystals are often rhombohedral (see Figure 22.5b) and sometimes curved (saddle dolomites) in habit. The color is white, brownish-gray, or rusty brown and the hardness is 4.

Dolomite occurs in low- and medium- temperature hydrothermal deposits and in sed- imentary rocks. Only in some rare cases, when dolomite crystallizes from highly saline (more than 15% salt) water of lagoons and lakes, is it a primary mineral of sedimentary rocks. More often dolomite is the result of secondary diage- netic processes transforming magnesian calcite into dolomite. Cerussite (PbCO 3) is a secondary product of lead ore oxidation, forming \ufb01ne-grained solid and dense gray aggregates. The crystals are semi- transparent, grayish-white, or even black, and have adamantine luster on their faces and greasy luster on fracture surfaces. The fracture surfaces are uneven or shell-like. The mineral is a lead ore, although not an important one. Aragonite (CaCO 3) crystallizes in the or- thorhombic system. Single crystals are tabular or prismatic in habit, but pseudohexagonal twinned intergrowths are more common. These inter- growths usually have indented angles and su- tures along the composition planes (Plate 9g). Aragonite also forms oolites and colloidal masses. The color is typically white, yellowish-white, brown, or gray, the luster is vitreous or greasy, and the hardness is 3.5--4. Aragonite crystallizes as precipitates of min- eral springs, in the oxidation zone of sul\ufb01de ores and weathering crusts, in marine chemical 2 \u00b5m Fig. 22.9 Scanning electron microscope image illustrating stacking of platelet-shaped crystals of aragonite in the nacre (mother-of-pearl) shell of a pearl oyster (courtesy C.

Thin platelets compose mother-of-pearl (nacre) in mol- lusk shells (Figure 22.9), combined with micro- scopic layers of protein (conchiolin). As we have mentioned above, aragonite is the high-pressure polymorph of CaCO 3 and has been found in some high-pressure--low-temperature metamor- phic rocks in subduction zones. In most occur- rences it is metastable and crystallizes for kinetic reasons. Malachite (Cu 2(CO3)(OH)2) is a mineral of the oxidation zone of chalcopyrite and other copper sul\ufb01de deposits.

Azurite (Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2) occurs as granular, crystalline, and colloform aggregates of dark blue and sky-blue color and is often accompanied by malachite (Plate 10a,c). The mineral is a compo- nent of many copper ores and is used in the pro- duction of blue paint. Formation conditions of carbonates Carbonates occur in many types of rock and in very diverse mineral deposits. Their major occur- rence, however, is in sedimentary rocks (limestone and dolostone). We will discuss the sedimentary mineral formation in some detail in the next sec- tion. The most abundant carbonate mineral, cal- cite, is often associated with organisms. Carbonatites are relatively rare carbonate rocks of igneous origin. In the upper mantle, at deep levels where ultrama\ufb01c and alkaline magmas nucleate, carbon exists as a native element, as carbonates, and as hydrocarbons. In silicate melts that are rich in carbon, a carbonate liquid may separate. The carbonate liquid is immiscible with the silicate portion of the melt. Crystallization of such a melt, generally at crustal levels, produces carbonatite dikes and stocks that consist largely of calcite, dolomite, or other carbonate miner- als. Carbonatites form as plugs in some volca- noes in the Recent East African rift systems. Very rarely alkaline \ufb02uorine--chlorine--carbonic lavas pour out on to the surface (e.g., at Oldoinyo Lengai in northern Tanzania), and such lavas crystallize to form rocks consisting of halite, \ufb02uorite, nyerereite (Na 2Ca(CO3)2), and gregoryite (Na2CO3). In ancient, deep-seated massifs that are presently exposed, primary carbonatites and sur- rounding silicate rocks are often altered owing to the interaction with aqueous-carbonic alkaline \ufb02uids. Carbonatites are often rich in rare earth el- ements (e.g., bastnaesite), niobium--tantalum ox- ides (e.g., pyrochlore), and zirconium oxides (e.g., baddeleyite). In hydrothermal deposits carbonates are com- mon and form under both medium- and low- temperature conditions in a neutral--alkaline environment. The most widespread carbonates of gold-bearing and polymetallic veins are calcite, dolomite, and siderite; rarer components of hy- drothermal veins are rhodochrosite, kutnahorite, witherite, and strontianite. In general the formation of the carbonates as a medium-temperature hydrothermal alteration of ultrama\ufb01c rocks is common and is caused by solutions enriched in CO 2.

They also precipitate as travertine and tufa from hot springs that penetrate limestone.

Carbonates in sedimentary rocks: chemical and biological origins Carbonate rocks comprise approximately one quarter of all sediments (Table 22.2) and carbon- ate minerals are, after silicates, the most impor- tant sedimentary component. The major carbon- ate rock is limestone; dolostone is less common, and carbonate evaporites are relatively rare. Car- bonates cannot exist in seawater below a critical depth, because the high CO 2 pressure causes dis- solution (Figure 22.12). The CO 2 content in sea- water has changed somewhat in accordance with the CO 2 partial pressure in the atmosphere over the course of geological history. Presently the crit- ical depth of carbonate dissolution is about 4.2 km in the Paci\ufb01c Ocean and about 4.7 km in the Atlantic Ocean. Carbonate sediments are typ- ical of continental shelves and of coral reefs. The map in Figure 22.13 documents their principal present-day distribution, which can be seen to be mainly in shallow oceans of the temperate and tropical zones. Interestingly, worldwide the ratio of dolomite to calcite decreased from the Precambrian era to the Quarternary period (Figure 22.14). Today dolomite forms only in minute amounts in a few very special environments. The reason for this change is still unclear and is known as \u2018\u2018the dolomite problem\u201d of sedimentary petrology. Some researchers attribute the change to variations in seawater composition, assuming that the earliest chemically precipitating car- bonates were dolomite. Subsequently, chemical dolomites were accompanied by biogenic (algal) dolomites and limestone in the Precambrian era. After the beginning of the Cambrian period,", "page": 389}

The dolomites continued to form only in arid continental areas, whereas limestones formed in both the oceans and continental basins, and in arid and humid climates. During the Mezozoic and Cenozoic, biogenic limestone formed not only within a shallow coastal zone, but also in deep-water zones owing to the large biomass of plankton organisms building their skeletons of calcium carbonate. The problem with this evolutionary theory is that present-day seawater also has a compo- sition favoring precipitation of dolomite, as is illustrated in a phase diagram of calcium and Table 22.2 Abundance, by vol.%, of rocks deposited on the earth\u2019s surface Clay Clastic Carbonate Evaporite Volcanic Platforms 46 22 24 2.8 4.5 Geoclinal belts 38 18 21 0.3 21 From Ronov and Yaroshevsky, 1969 magnesium activities versus the CO 2 pressure (Figure 22.15), and yet calcite forms dominantly.

Dolomite forms because of either the dissociation of initial Mg-rich calcite into calcite and dolomite 10(Ca0.8Mg0.2)CO3 \u21cc 2CaMg(CO3)2 + 6CaCO3 or the metasomatic replacement of calcite by dolomite under the in\ufb02uence of secondary porous solutions rich in magnesium. Carbonates can dissolve in the early diage- netic stages. For instance, calcite skeletons in recent alluvium are easily dissolved in humid regions because fresh river waters ordinarily are acidic (pH > 7). Similarly, a high CO 2 content in cold seawater causes calcium carbonate to dissociate: H2O + CO2 \u21cc H2CO3 CaCO3 + H2CO3 \u21cc Ca2+ + 2HCO\u2212 3 Diagenesis applies not only to carbonate min- erals. Silica minerals transform from amorphous opal to cryptocrystalline chalcedony and ulti- mately to quartz. Clay minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite change to mica (hydromica and sericite, later muscovite) and chlorite. There is a regular progression in zeolites from phillipsite to clinoptilolite, analcime, and lau- montite and in a \ufb01nal stage of diagenesis pla- gioclase feldspar and epidote appear. These and other diagenetic transformations are illustrated in Figure 22.18. Dissolution and reprecipitation are only one side of the diagenetic transforma- tion of sedimentary carbonate rocks. The activ- ity of bacteria, decomposition of organic mate- rial, and variations in CO 2 and O2 concentrations cause gradual changes in Eh and pH conditions with complex mineral-forming processes.

{"text": "Chapter 23 Phosphates, sulfates, and related minerals. Apatite as a biogenic mineral Introduction In Chapter 22 we discussed the triangular plane CO2\u2212 3 group as a fundamental building block of carbonates. In phosphates and sulfates the funda- mental building block group is either the PO 3\u2212 4 or the SO 2\u2212 4 tetrahedron, respectively. The crys- tal structures are rather complicated in detail, and we will not elaborate on them. However, it is noteworthy that several phosphate struc- tures are identical with silicate structures, and these we will study in more depth in Chapters 26--29. For example, berlinite (AlPO 4)i si s o s t r u c - tural with quartz (SiO2), triphyline (LiFePO4)w i t h olivine (Mg 2SiO4), and xenotime (YPO 4)w i t hz i r - con (ZrSiO 4). Mostly though, phosphate and sul- fate coordination polyhedra are isolated, whereas in silicates, the tetrahedra are generally polymer- ized to form sheets, chains, and frameworks. Re- lated to phosphates and sulfates are arsenates, vanadates, and tungstates, with AsO 3\u2212 4 ,a n dV O3\u2212 4 and WO2\u2212 4 tetrahedra, respectively. The minerals in these groups are of consider- able economic interest. Apatite (Ca 5(PO4)3(F, OH, Cl)), is a major source of phosphorus used as fer- tilizer as well as the main constituent of bones and teeth. Gypsum (CaSO 4\u00b72H2O) is used as a building material, and scheelite (CaWO 4)i st h e major tungsten ore. Phosphates, arsenates, and vanadates Phosphates and related minerals are numerous, but they are rather rare minerals in the earth\u2019s crust. Some more common examples are listed in Table 23.1. The vanadate vanadinite (Pb(VO 4)3Cl) is isostructural with apatite and there are limited isomorphic substitutions of phosphor, vanadium, and arsenic. Vanadates may have also other co- ordination polyhedra such as VO 5\u2212 5 ,V O 7\u2212 6 ,a n d V2O6\u2212 8 . Many of these minerals contain additional OH\u2212,F \u2212,a n dC l \u2212, and molecular water. The main cations are Ca 2+,A l 3+,F e 2+,C u 2+,C o 3+, and Ni3+. The \u2018\u2018uranium micas\u201d such as carnotite (K2(UO2)2(VO4)2\u00b73H2O) contain also UO 2+ 2 with uranium in 6-fold valency. Brief description of important phosphate minerals Monazite (CePO4) usually contains other rare earth elements besides cerium. In addition, some thorium (with a rather complicated isomorphic scheme: Ce 3+ + Ce2+\u21cc Ca2+ + Th4+,o rC e 3+ + P5+\u21cc Th4+ + Si4+) and uranium may be present in the mineral. The maximum contents of ThO 2 and UO2 are 32 weight% and 7 weight%, respec- tively. Monazite is found in thick tabular and iso- metric isolated crystals. Monazite crystals from granite pegmatites (Figure 23.1) morphologically resemble garnet, but monazite has a cleavage and a lower hardness (Mohs\u2019 scale 5.5).

In thin sections, apatite has a characteristic mottled texture. Apatite occurs in a wide range of rocks and deposits as isolated crystals and grains, usu- ally small in size (1--2 mm). The largest and most perfect apatite crystals are found in granite pegmatites and marbles. The main use of apatite is as a fertilizer in the agricultural industry. The industrially important concentrations of ap- atite are in nepheline-bearing alkaline rocks. In alkaline rocks the impregnations, compact veins, lenses, and segregations of sugar-like ap- atite compose extensive deposits in which the ap- atite content may reach 80 weight% over tens of kilometers, such as in the Khibini massif of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. In sedimentary rocks the mineral forms layers called phosphorites that often contain nodules of \ufb01ne acicular--radial structure. Other compo- nents of phosphorites are shell and bone frag- ments and other apatite-bearing organic remains. Apatite is a main constituent of the solid tissue of vertebrates and of brachyopod skeletons. (We will discuss the biomineralogical origins of apatite later in this chapter.)

While they have no economic signi\ufb01cance, the minerals are used by prospec- tors and are indicative of cobalt and nickel ores. Erithrite and annabergite are easily recognized by their striking pink and pale green colors, respectively. Sulfates and tungstates Sulfate minerals are the natural salts of sulfu- ric acid H 2SO4. They include acid, basic, and intermediate salts and crystallohydrates (see Table 23.2). All these minerals have isolated com- plex anion groups SO 2\u2212 4 in the form of tetrahedra in their structures. In gypsum, double columns of stacked SO2\u2212 4 tetrahedra are linked to columns of Ca2+, and columns of water molecules. Columns extend along the c-axis (a c projection is shown in Figure 23.2). This structural arrangement pro- duces an excellent (010) cleavage. Sulfates are not (010) b a = H2O = SO4 = Ca2+2\u2013 Fig. 23.2 (001) projection of the structure of gypsum with isolated SO2\u2212 4 tetrahedra. The (010) cleavage plane is indicated by dashed lines, unit cell by solid lines. widespread in nature; the most abundant min- erals are gypsum, anhydrite, and barite. There are about 200 sulfate minerals. In exogenic environments, sulfates such as thenardite, ep- somite, anhydrite, and gypsum form evaporites. Some sulfates (among them barite, gypsum, and anhydrite) also occur in hydrothermal ore de- posits. Tungstates, with WO 2\u2212 4 tetrahedra instead of SO2\u2212 4 , are closely related to sulfates. Brief description of important sulfate and tungstate minerals Two isostructural minerals, barite (BaSO4)a n d celestite (SrSO4) form a limited solid solution. Crystals of these minerals are rhombic--prismatic or tabular in habit, often transparent and white, yellow, brown (when inclusions of limonite are present), or blue in color, with vitreous luster. Stepped fracture surfaces mark perfect cleavages on three planes (parallel to prism and pinacoid faces). Barite often occurs as crested aggregates (Figure 23.3), frequently associated with \ufb02uorite. Barite is recognized by its high density of about 4.5 g/cm 3. Celestite and barite are often found in druses and granular aggregates. Barite forms in medium- and low-temperature hydrothermal de- posits, while celestite develops as secretions in sedimentary rocks.

{"text": "IMPORTANT SULFATE AND TUNGSTATE MINERALS 383 Barite is used to manufacture paints and in the chemical, rubber, and paper industries. The high density makes barite useful as an additive to drilling mud in deep drilling projects. It is also used to cap oil and gas wells. Celestite is used for sugar manufacturing, in pyrotechnology, and in pharmaceuticals. Anhydrite (CaSO 4) is a typical mineral of evaporite deposits. In association with gypsum it forms massive marble-like layers of various thicknesses within a sedimentary series. Un- like calcite, anhydrite does not react with hy- drochloric acid. This orthorhombic mineral is also found as grains in medium-temperature hy- drothermal sul\ufb01de ore deposits. Crystals are or- dinarily white, gray, or lilac in color and display excellent cleavage on (010), (100), and (001) planes. Anhydrite also occurs in some metamorphic rocks. The mineral is a raw material for cement production. Anglesite (PbSO 4) is generally a product of galena oxidation. It is often found as massive granular and colloform aggregates, druses, and crusts. Crystals of anglesite are prismatic--tabular in habit and colorless or white and gray in color. Anglesite may be dif\ufb01cult to distinguish from isostructural barite since it also has a high density (6.3 g/cm 3). Contrary to barite it is often associated with galena. Gypsum (CaSO4\u00b72H2O) forms \ufb02attened and prismatic crystals with monoclinic symmetry. Distinctive swallowtail twins are common (Figure 23.4a). The habit ranges from tabular to prismatic (Figure 23.4b). Crystals are colorless and transpar- ent with vitreous or pearly luster. The mineral has a perfect (010) cleavage. The aggregates of gyp- sum are white, clear, or translucent. Its hardness is 1.5--2 in single crystals and reaches 3 in gran- ular masses. Gypsum forms as a low-temperature hy- drothermal mineral, crystallizing from meteoric water circulating in sandstones and clays, but the major occurrence of the mineral is in evap- orite deposits. As a solution becomes supersatu- rated, gypsum, anhydrite, and halite precipitate out consecutively and form alternating layers of these minerals (see Chapter 21). Sedimentary gyp- sum is found in \ufb01ne-grained massive rocks. These (a) (b) Fig. 23.4 (a) Platy crystal of gypsum with swallow-tail twin from E. Mojavedesert, California (width 100 mm) (photograph P . Gennaro). (b) Prismatic crystals of gypsum from Eisleben, Saxony, Germany (width 110 mm) (courtesy O. Medenbach). rocks often contain gypsum as veins, geodes, and nests of euhedral crystals or as parallel \ufb01brous aggregates. Gypsum also grows on the surface of clay or sand. Such crystals incorporate clay par- ticles and sand grains, and exhibit a \ufb02ower-like morphology (desert roses), which we have dis- cussed in Chapter 5 (see Figure 5.24). Gypsum is recognized by the shape of its crystals and twins, its perfect cleavage, and its low hardness. It is used mainly in the production of cement and plaster for the construction industry. Alunite (KAl 3(SO4)2(OH)6) forms by hydrother- mal alteration of felsic volcanic rocks. Its for- mation is a result of the interaction between", "page": 402}

Feldspars, for example, trans- form to alunite according to the following reaction: 3KAlSi 3O8 + 2SO2\u2212 4 + 10H+ \u21cc K-feldspar KAl3(SO4)2(OH)2 + 9SiO2 + 2K+ + 4H2O Alunite Alunite is found in solid, massive, chalcedony- like layered aggregates of patchy color and in loose masses that replace volcanic rocks. These aggregates have a hardness ranging from 3 to 7. The mineral is an aluminum ore and a source of potassium. Wolframite is a general name for min- erals that belong to the isomorphic series FeWO 4\u2212MnWO4. The symmetry is monoclinic. Wolframites form black, dark-brown, or reddish- brown tabular and prismatic roughly striated crystals. Their hardness is about 5. Wolframites are easily cleaved on a (010) plane. Cleav- age planes show an adamantine or a strong semimetallic (\u2018\u2018old mirror\u2019\u2019) luster. The streak is brown or pale-brown, similar to that of sphalerite. The density of wolframites is nearly 7 g/cm 3. These minerals form in quartz veins and are sometimes found in placers. They are mined as a tungsten ore. Diagnostic properties of wolframite include crystal morphology, cleavage character, \u2018\u2018mirror\u2019\u2019 luster, and high density. Having similar streak, color and perfect cleavage, wolframite can be mis- taken for sphalerite, but the cubic sphalerite has a {111} cleavage in several directions, forms iso- metric, not elongate or tabular crystals, and is much less dense than wolframite. Scheelite (CaWO 4) forms mainly in quartz veins (together with wolframite, cassiterite, and sul\ufb01des) and in skarns. It occurs as tetragonal bipyramidal crystals of white, yellowish-white color with resinous luster (Figure 23.5). Scheel- ite\u2019s hardness is 4.5, and it displays {111} cleav- age. It is easily mistaken for quartz and calcite. Bright, blue and white \ufb02uorescence is the best diagnostic property (Plate 6a,b). Scheelite is the major tungsten ore.

Biogenic processes Biogenic mineral deposits form in surface envi- ronments as transformations of primary organic aggregates or as a result of biochemical pro- cesses. Biogenic minerals are not minerals in the strict conventional sense because life is involved. However, organisms produce many of the same substances that form inorganically in rocks and therefore a discussion of these organic processes is appropriate. Biogenic minerals originate from living or- ganisms or with their assistance; all crystallize within living organisms as a result of cell ac- tivity and are surrounded by organic material. Classical examples are the bones of vertebrates. Bones and teeth consist of \ufb01ne \ufb01bers or platy crystals of a mineral closely related to carbonate-hydroxyapatite with an idealized for- mula Ca 5(PO4)2(CO3OH)OH. These crystals are sus- pended in organic collagen, a protein. The ap- atite crystals, which often do not exceed 10 nm in length, comprise up to 70 weight% of the dried bone, protein making up the remaining 30%.

In Chapter 22 we noted that mother- of-pearl is composed of layers of aragonite (see Figure 22.10), separated by the protein conchia- line. Some mineral-like crystals form abnormally, such as gall and kidney stones (Chapter 33). In all, about 80 different minerals occur within fossil and recent animals and plants; Table 23.3 pro- vides a summary. Very unusual applications of minerals by or- ganisms are calcite single crystals that acted as lenses in the eyes of the long-extinct trilobites. Recently it has been discovered that calcite crys- tals are distributed over the body of the eyeless invertebrate brittlestar ( Ophiocoma wendtii), a rel- ative of the star\ufb01sh. The crystals act as powerful micro-lenses that collect light and focus it on nerve bundles. The many crystallites thus form a compound eye. Even a mineral such as magnetite, which is generally considered to be representative of high- temperature rock-forming conditions, has been found as small grains in the tissues of salmon, bees, butter\ufb02ies, tortoises, pigs, and birds. Car- rier pigeons rely on magnetite magnetism to orient themselves during cloudy weather when they cannot use the sun or stars. Magnetite serves as an amazing biomineralogical backup navigation system. Magnetite crystals also occur in primitive bacteria such as Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum as minute crystals often aligned in chains (Figure 23.7). Each crystal is a single magnetic domain (see Chapter 8) and thus constitutes a dipole, enabling the bacteria to align in magnetic \ufb01elds (Stolz, 1992). They occur near the oxic/anoxic transition zone. Above it iron is ferric and insoluble, below it is mostly ferrous sul\ufb01de. However, within the transition zone there is soluble ferrous iron, and bacteria may \ufb01nd this optimal zone more ef\ufb01ciently by using the inclination of the earth\u2019s magnetic \ufb01eld to point them in a downward direction.

{"text": "Chapter 24 Sul\ufb01des and related minerals. Hydrothermal processes Introduction About 500 minerals belong to the sul\ufb01des and related minerals, and most consist of metal and semimetal sul\ufb01des such as pyrite (FeS 2), chalcopy- rite (CuFeS 2), and sphalerite (ZnS). Sul\ufb01des are generally subdivided into three chemical classes: (a) simple sul\ufb01des that are salts of HS (e.g., spha- lerite, ZnS is the zinc salt of HS); (b) salts of thioacids, which are oxygen-free acids with sul- fur playing the role of oxygen (e.g., pyrargyrite, Ag 3SbS3 is the silver salt of the sulfoacid H 3SbS3), and (c) polysulfuric compounds (persul\ufb01des) that can be considered as salts of the polysulfuric acid H 2S2, which contains the bivalent S 2\u2212 2 molecule (pyrite is an example). The closest analog to sul- \ufb01des are arsenides and their complex compounds (arsenide--sul\ufb01des) such as realgar (AsS) and arsenopyrite (FeAsS), with structures similar to that of pyrite. Sul\ufb01des are of great industrial importance and are the major ores for copper, zinc, lead, mercury, bismuth, cobalt, nickel, and other non- ferrous metals. (Ferrous metals such as iron, chromium and manganese are not extracted from sul\ufb01des, because sulfur interferes with the metal recovery process.) Sul\ufb01des are also the sources of arsenic and antimony. Although pyrite is not an ore for iron, it is used to produce sul- furic acid and it is also an important gold ore, containing small fragments of native gold as in- clusions. Crystal chemistry The structural properties of sul\ufb01des are deter- mined by bonding between a metal and sulfur, which is highly ionizing. The S 2\u2212 ionic radius is large (1.84 \u02daA) compared with that of metals, and most sul\ufb01de structures do not correspond to simple close packing of anions with cations in in- terstices (sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS), cinnabar (HgS), pyrrhotite (FeS), and chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) are exceptions). The large sulfur ions easily be- come polarized, and complex anion groups (S 2\u2212 2 ) may form due to covalent pairing. In general, sul- \ufb01des display a great diversity of crystal structures with complex bonding (ionic--metallic--covalent) in which metallic bonding always plays a consid- erable role. Among the numerous structures are polyhedral types, types with isolated molecular groups (S 2), and types in which sulfur is linked to bands and sheets (Table 24.1). A typical example of a polyhedral sulfide is galena, with the same structure as halite (NaCl), in which both cations and anions have a co- ordination number of 6. The structure can be viewed as close-packing of S 2\u2212 with Pb2+ in octa- hedral interstices. Polyhedral structures are also found in sphalerite, wurtzite, pyrrhotite, nickel- ine, and chalcopyrite. In the conventional unit cell of sphalerite small Zn 2+ are arranged on an fcc lattice and large S 2\u2212 occupy alternate eighth cubes (Figure 24.1a). However, the origin of the unit cell can be shifted to put S 2\u2212 into the corners", "page": 407}

(b) Iron ions in pyrite are arranged as in an fcc lattice. Each Fe is coordinated octahedrally by six S. (Figure 24.1b) and in this case it becomes obvi- ous that Zn 2+ are in tetrahedral coordination (Figure 24.1c). Chalcopyrite is structurally closely related to sphalerite but Cu 2+ and Fe 2+ atoms are ordered over the positions of the fcc lattice and this destroys the cubic symmetry and pro- duces a tetragonal structure. Polyhedral sul\ufb01des generally have a cubic (or pseudocubic) mor- phology, with cubes, octahedra, or tetrahedra as dominant forms. An example for minerals with S 2\u2212 2 groups, rather than isolated S 2\u2212, is pyrite. This structure has also a resemblance to NaCl, if we consider that the Cl \u2212 are replaced by S 2\u2212 2 groups directed along body-diagonals of the cube (Figure 24.2a). Fe2+ occupy an fcc lattice, with each ion coordi- nated by six sulfur atoms in a tilted octahedral coordination (Figure 24.2b). The oblique sulfur groups reduce the high symmetry in NaCl and PbS. Even though pyrite crystallizes frequently as cubes, a surface striation indicates that a 4-fold rotation axis does not exist (cubic point group 2/m\u00af3; see Figure 5.28a and Plate 11c). While in pyrite the group is S 2\u2212 2 (Figure 24.3b), other groups are found such as AsS 3\u2212 (e.g., cobaltite (Figure 24.3c)) and As 4\u2212 4 (e.g., skutteru- dite (Figure 24.3d)), as illustrated schematically in Figure 24.3. In these complexes, atoms share outer electrons to attain an inert gas con\ufb01gura- tion, acquiring additional electrons from metal cations. Realgar (As 4S4)i sas p e c i a lc a s eo fa purely covalent group sul\ufb01de. In realgar, atoms are linked by covalent bonds to form two rings, and this molecular structure is charge-balanced without additional metal ions (Figure 24.3a). Van der Waals bonds connect the groups, which is the reason for the low hardness (Mohs\u2019 scale 1.5-- 2) and low melting point (310 \u25e6C) of realgar.

The S-Mo-S sheets are linked by weak van der Waals bonds, resulting in an excel- lent cleavage and low hardness of this mineral, similar to graphite. Many sul\ufb01des are reminiscent of metals owing to the pronounced metallic luster and var- iously shaded metallic colors (mostly gray-black and yellow, and more rarely red and blue), resem- bling iron, aluminum, or brass. Sul\ufb01des are elec- trical conductors owing to the prevailing metallic bonding, which is also responsible for the luster. In fact, sul\ufb01des are potentially both ionic and electrical conductors. Correspondingly, adjacent grains of two different sul\ufb01des that occur in the same ore form a galvanic micro-cell with an elec- tric potential when in contact with water. Elec- trochemical reactions take place, with ions par- tially migrating into a solution and creating a dispersion of metals around sul\ufb01de ore deposits that can be used for prospecting. We will discuss this at the end of this chapter. Brief description of important sul\ufb01de minerals Chalcocite (Cu2S) occurs as solid masses, nod- ules, and veinlets within copper sandstone. It has a grayish-black color, submetallic luster, and a rough fracture surface. The mineral is usually covered with a thin coating of brightly colored malachite or azurite. It is recognized by its color, by the forms of its occurrence and by the colored coatings. A shiny scratch distinguishes it from minerals of the tetrahedrite group. Chalcocite is a low-temperature hydrothermal mineral and also occurs in zones of ore oxidation with secondary sul\ufb01de enrichment.", "page": 410}
{"text": "IMPORTANT SULFIDE MINERALS 393 Galena (PbS) has a cubic structure and often a cubic or cube-octahedral morphology and a perfect cubic cleavage. There are limited isomor- phic substitutions of silver, tin, thallium, sele- nium, and tellurium. If you have ever seen the almost perfect galena cubes or octahedra in small druses, you will never forget them (see Figure 4.1e and Plate 13a). Galena often occurs with quartz, calcite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. Its color is lead-gray, and its luster varies from metallic to faded metallic. It has a low hardness and a high density (7.4 g/cm 3). Galena forms in hydrother- mal deposits, skarns, and stratiform deposits. The mineral is a major lead ore but silver, bismuth, and thallium are also extracted from galena. Sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S) may contain minor amounts of manganese, cadmium, mercury, and tin. The mineral is cubic and forms tetrahedral crystals, often euhedral (Figure 24.6a, Plate 12a). The equiaxed grains have a submetallic luster on cleavage surfaces. Since the cleavage is do- decahedral {110} with six nonparallel planes, re- \ufb02ections occur in many directions as the sam- p l ei sr o t a t e d .M a n yp r o p e r t i e sd e p e n do nt h e isomorphic substitutions: iron-free varieties are transparent, colorless, greenish, or honey-yellow and have a striking adamantine luster; samples that are low in iron but contain manganese are reddish-brown in color; and iron-rich sphalerites are brownish black and black with a semimetallic luster and weaker cleavage. Powders and streaks of all varieties are pale to dark brown. The min- eral is easily recognized on the basis of color, luster, and cleavage, as well as its association with galena, quartz, and calcite. Sphalerite gen- erally occurs in hydrothermal deposits, skarns, and stratiform ores. It is mined for zinc and cadmium. Cinnabar (HgS) is found as crimson-red and carmine-red grains in porous sandstones, graywackes, and marbles. It may also occur in stibnite- and \ufb02uorite-bearing quartz veins. The low-temperature polymorph has hexagonal sym- metry, high-temperature metacinnabar is cubic. Large cinnabar grains display rhombohedral mor- phology, often with interpenetration twins and pseudocubic cleavage (Figure 5.14b, Plate 12e). The luster of individual grains is adamantine, whereas that of aggregates is greasy or matte. Cinnabar is recognized by its color, red streak, high density (8.1 g/cm 3), and the association with \ufb02uorite, stibnite, and quartz. Cinnabar forms in low-temperature hydrothermal deposits and is t h em a i no r ef o rm e r c u r y . Pyrrhotite has a variable composition ap- proaching FeS, but generally is found with some iron de\ufb01ciency owing to structural defects. Chem- ical formulas range from Fe 0.83S to FeS. Pyrrhotite occurs in solid \ufb01ne-grained masses with a dull metal-like luster and uneven fracture surfaces. Crystals are rare and have a tabular pseudo- hexagonal habit (Figure 24.6b). Pyrrhotite is eas- ily weathered and becomes covered with a brown \ufb01lm that hides its natural color. Some pyrrhotites have weak magnetic", "page": 411}

The mineral has no practical application; on the contrary, it is an undesirable component for many metallurgical technologies. A diagnostic property of pyrrhotite is the bronze color on fresh surfaces. Beginners often mistake pyrrhotite for pyrite, but the latter gen- erally occurs as good crystals and has a more golden-yellowish color. Pentlandite approaches the formula Fe 4Ni4 (Co, Ni, Fe, Ag) S 8. The identi\ufb01cation of this min- eral is often dif\ufb01cult. It occurs in \ufb01ne-grained chalcopyrite--pyrrhotite aggregates in ultrama\ufb01c and ma\ufb01c rocks. It resembles chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite in color but the strong metallic luster and perfect octahedral cleavage distin- guish it. Pentlandite almost never occurs with pyrite. The mineral forms in magmatic copper- -nickel sul\ufb01de ores and is the principal ore of nickel. Nickeline (NiS) occurs in hydrothermal uranium-bearing deposits as \ufb01ne-grained kidney- shaped aggregates of light copper-red color. In ox- idation zones nickeline is often replaced by pow- dery annabergite masses (Ni 3(AsO4)2\u00b78H2O), pale green or green in color. Realgar (As4S4) forms bright reddish-orange prismatic crystals with an adamantine luster (Plate 12f). It also occurs as granular masses and veinlets in calcite-bearing rocks. The mineral is brittle and has uneven and rough fracture sur- faces. It occurs in low-temperature hydrothermal deposits and is accompanied by yellow orpiment", "page": 411}

The as- sociation with yellow orpiment, to which it alters under the in\ufb02uence of light, and the orange color and streak distinguish realgar from cinnabar. Orpiment (As 2S3) occurs as elongated--platy crystals and sun\ufb02ower-like radiating aggregates, or in the form of earthy masses. The mineral has a bright golden-yellow color and a perfect tabular cleavage, with a pearly luster on cleav- age surfaces. Orpiment forms in low-temperature hydrothermal deposits together with realgar, quartz, and calcite and is, like realgar, an arsenic ore. Stibnite (Sb 2S3) crystallizes in the orthorhom- bic system as columnar or needle-shaped crys- tals with a striation parallel to the elongation (Figure 24.6c). The color is dark gray, but tar- nished crystal faces are bright indigo-blue. The luster is metallic. Stibnite cleaves parallel to the elongation, and cleavage planes often display a transverse striation. A characteristic property of stibnite is that it burns when struck against a hard surface.

Molybdenite (MoS 2) crystallizes in the hexag- onal system as platy crystals with gray color of slightly bluish tint, bright metallic or greasy lus- ter, and perfect (0001) cleavage (Figure 24.6d). The mineral is easily identi\ufb01ed by its low hardness (1) and greasy touch. Graphite, which it resembles, has a darker color and a more intense streak. The molybdenite streak becomes greenish when rubbed. Rose-shaped, scaly, or massive aggregates of molybdenite are common. Molybdenite occurs in different high-tempera- ture deposits. Commercially important concen- trations are associated with high-temperature hydrothermal deposits and skarns. It is mined for molybdenum sul\ufb01de (a lubricant) and molyb- denum. Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) commonly occurs in granular aggregates, veinlets, and nodules. Eu- hedral pseudocubic crystals are rare (Plate 12c). The mineral has a greenish-yellow (\u2018\u2018brass yellow\u2019\u2019) color with a speci\ufb01c tint that is dif\ufb01cult to describe and needs to be experienced. This tint distinguishes chalcopyrite (Plate 12c) from the similar pyrite (Plate 11c). Chalcopyrite has uneven fracture surfaces, metallic luster, and a greenish- black streak. It is easily oxidized and covered with iridescent blue, green, and red \ufb01lms of bornite and covellite (Plate 12d). Chalcopyrite grains are often partially or completely replaced by iron hy- droxides, malachite, and azurite on the surface and along fractures. Chalcopyrite is an important copper ore. It is common and found in industrially valuable con- centrations in magmatic sul\ufb01de ores, medium- temperature hydrothermal deposits, copper sand- stones, and skarns. Bornite (Cu 5FeS4) occurs as irregularly shaped pockets and veinlets in copper sandstones and as thin secondary coatings on chalcopyrite.

It is used as a copper ore. Tetrahedrite (Cu 12(SbS3)4S) and tennantite (Cu12(AsS3)4S) form a continuous solid solution. Silver, zinc and iron may substitute for copper, and bismuth and tellurium for arsenic and anti- mony. Therefore, there is quite a range of compo- sitions in the tetrahedrite group. The most abun- dant minerals are copper--arsenic and copper-- antimony compounds, which are similar in color and morphology. Crystals are rare (Plate 12b), and irregular aggregates are more common. The minerals have a gray-black color and a dull metallic luster. The tetrahedrite minerals are constituents of medium-temperature (sometimes low-temperature) hydrothermal deposits and, in particular, of gold deposits.

{"text": "396 SULFIDES. HYDROTHERMAL PROCESSES Pyrite (FeS2) may contain some cobalt, nickel, arsenic, copper, and antimony. The mineral of- ten occurs as cubes {100} (see Figure 5.28a) and dodecahedra {210} with pentagons as faces (so- called pyritohedra, Plate 11c) or combinations of the two forms. The faces display characteristic striations that are due to a microscopic alterna- tion of {100} and {210} growth. Pyrite has a straw yellow or golden-yellow color (hence the name \u2018\u2018fool\u2019s gold\u2019\u2019), strong metallic luster, and a high hardness (6.5, higher than glass). These proper- ties aid in its identi\ufb01cation and distinguish it from the similar chalcopyrite. When hammered, pyrite produces a sulfurous smell. During oxida- tion, iron hydroxide minerals called \u2018\u2018limonite\u2019\u2019 replace pyrite. Pseudomorphs after pyrite, which maintain details of the pyrite morphology, are common (Figure 5.7). Pyrite is the most abundant sul\ufb01de mineral and is present in a majority of rocks and deposits. It is used mainly in the production of sulfuric acid. It is an undesirable component of iron ores. Sometimes pyrite is used as a gold ore when it contains \ufb01ne dispersions of gold. Cobaltite (Co(AsS)) has crystals similar to those of pyrite and also forms granular coat- ings in ores, but, unlike pyrite, it is pinkish- gray in color and displays a cleavage. Cobaltite occurs mainly in skarns and other high- temperature hydrothermal rocks. In oxidation zones, cobaltite is gradually replaced by pink ery- thrite (Co 3(AsO4)2\u00b78H2O) powder. It is a cobalt ore. Marcasite (FeS2) is orthorhombic and forms spear-shaped crystals with rhombic bipyramids that are frequently twinned. It occurs as radiat- ing aggregates and concretions (Plate 11d) and is often intergrown with pyrite. The mineral has a pale-yellow color, slightly darker than that of pyrite, and has a metallic luster. Its hardness is 6. Marcasite is found in sedimentary rocks and m o r er a r e l ya sal a t e - s t a g ep h a s ei ns o m eh y - drothermal deposits. Like pyrite, it is used to manufacture sulfuric acid. Arsenopyrite (Fe(AsS)) contains minor substi- tutions of nickel, tin and cobalt for iron. Its symmetry is orthorhombic. Elongated or wedge- shaped crystals with a rough striation are typ- ical. The mineral is steel-gray or slightly bronze in color, has a striking metallic luster, a hardness of 6 and sometimes displays a cleavage. Arsenopy- rite produces a \u2018\u2018garlic\u2019\u2019 smell when hammered. It occurs in high- and medium-temperature de- posits, and in the latter is often accompanied by native gold. It is used for arsenic extraction. Sulfide genesis and hydrothermal deposits Only rarely do sul\ufb01des form by primary mag- matic processes. In nature, sul\ufb01de minerals crys- tallize predominantly from aqueous solutions at temperatures below 600 \u25e6C. Magmatic ore-forming processes Let us \ufb01rst look brie\ufb02y at magmatic metal ore- forming processes. When magma crystallizes dur- ing cooling, different minerals form at different temperatures.

Layers of this type are par- ticularly important in ma\ufb01c and ultrama\ufb01c in- trusions, such as the Bushveld complex in South Africa, with layers of chromite and magnetite containing platinum and vanadium minerals (see also Chapter 30). Some magmas dissociate in the course of their crystallization history into two immiscible liquids of different composition. One magma is a typical silicate magma, while the other is rich in metal sul\ufb01des or oxides (Figure 24.7, top). The immiscible sul\ufb01de melt is heavier than the silicate melt and sinks to the bottom of the chamber with droplets and pockets coalescing to form large deposits of nickel-rich sul\ufb01des. Crys- tallization of the dominant silicate melt pro- duces dunites, peridotites, and gabbros. Crys- tallization of the sul\ufb01de melt produces segre- gations, dispersed in the already existing sili- cate rock, with such minerals as pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite. Tectonic movements may cause the sul\ufb01de melt to intrude along fractures.

An example is the nickel\u2013iron mineralization at Sudbury, Canada (after Kesler, 1994). impact probably caused formation and emplace- ment of a ma\ufb01c magma. Hydrothermal ore-forming processes Hydrothermal sul\ufb01de deposits are more com- mon than magmatic deposits and form because of precipitation of minerals from largely aque- ous or carbonaceous--aqueous supercritical \ufb02uids, and liquid solutions. The depths of their occur- rence range from 5 km to surface conditions. The solutions can be magmatic water released during crystallization of a silicate melt, meta- morphic water that becomes free during min- eral reactions of progressive metamorphism, sedimentary water that is expelled during com- paction, atmospheric water penetrating rocks (meteoric water), or seawater. The different types of hydrothermal solution can be distinguished on the basis of their isotopic composition (see Figure 16.1). In order for the solutions to become mobile, there must be rock porosity or fracturing. Hydrothermal solutions are often saline and very reactive, causing alteration of the country rock adjacent to the fracture. Take, as a typical example, a fracture in gran- ite (Figure 24.8). As a result of chemical inter- actions between the feldspars of granites and the ore-transporting aqueous solutions that pass through them, the granite becomes altered and the solution changes composition. Some of the reactions that take place during the alteration of various feldspars are 3NaAlSi3O8 + 2H+ + K+ \u2192 Albite KAl2Si3AlO10(OH)2 + 3Na+ + 6SiO2 Muscovite Quartz 3KAlSi3O8 + 2H+ \u2192 Microcline KAl2Si3AlO10(OH)2 + K+ + 6SiO2 Muscovite Quartz CaAl2Si2O8 + 4F\u2212 + 4H+ \u2192 Anorthite Al2SiO4F2 + SiO2 + CaF2 + 2H2O Topaz Quartz Fluorite Muscovite is often in a \ufb01ne-grained form called sericite, and associated with minerals such as topaz and \ufb02uorite.

Even then, it was no- ticed that the altered rock had formed owing to a metasomatic transformation of granite. Today it is clear that greisens accompany most high- temperature hydrothermal veins that cross gran- ites, and they constitute considerable volumes in shallow granite intrusions. In the case of the vein from the Erzgebirge shown in Figure 24.8, a layer of lepidolite (Li-mica) separates the quartz vein containing the ore minerals from the host rock. The greisens are signi\ufb01cant sources of tin (cassi- terite), tungsten (scheelite and wolframite), and, sometimes, gemstones (beryl, topaz, tourmaline). While the host rock is altered and solu- tions circulate through open fractures, new minerals precipitate from the fracture walls of an earlier generation of minerals. This has been illustrated in the classical drawings of W. Maucher (1914), which have been reproduced in many textbooks. Figure 24.9 shows mineral- ization in a sericitic gneiss of the Erzgebirge near Freiberg, Germany. Crystallization of \ufb01ne- prismatic quartz on the fracture surface of the greisen host rock is followed by sphalerite (black), with some arsenopyrite. A younger gen- eration of quartz with more massive crystals follows. The last minerals that precipitate are scalenohedral calcite, saddle-shaped siderite, and chalcopyrite. The crystallization sequence of hydrothermal solutions is very complicated, and depends on temperature, pressure, composition, pH, redox potential Eh, and concentration. All these fac- tors can change easily, both locally and with time. They are in\ufb02uenced by the velocity of the hydrothermal solutions moving through the host, mixing of different solutions, temperature gradients, and reactions with the underlying rocks. It is, therefore, impossible to draw gen- eral conclusions. Nevertheless, hydrothermal al- terations have been classi\ufb01ed according to their relationship with igneous processes and by the temperature conditions under which they take place. Hydrothermal ore-deposits are divided into plutonic, volcanic, and so-called telethermal de- posits, which are far removed from igneous activity. Depending on temperature, hydrother- mal ores have characteristic chemical and mineralogical compositions and morphology (Table 24.2). Let us \ufb01rst review some features of plutonic hy- drothermal deposits. In Chapter 19 we explored the formation of granitic rocks and pegmatites. With", "page": 416}

Fine prismatic quartz (1) is overgrown by sphalerite, striated orthorhombic crystals of arsenopyrite, large stubby quartz (2), and galena. On top of the younger quartz are small crystals of calcite, siderite, and chalcopyrite. (Drawing from W. Maucher, 1914.) increasing crystallization (and decreasing tem- perature) a granitic magma becomes enriched in water and elements that do not substitute in the structures of major rock-forming silicates. This includes many heavy-metal ions. Pegmatites and aplites form at the transition from late magmatic to hydrothermal crystallization. They have char- acteristics of dikes formed by igneous intrusions, as well as those of veins precipitating from aque- ous solutions. At high temperatures (400--600 \u25e6C) and mod- erate pressures (above 20 MPa), water is in a supercritical state (see Figure 17.1). Crystalliza- tion produces an increase in vapor pressure, causing shattering of rocks and formation of a highly permeable fracture zone adjacent to the granitic intrusion. Hydrothermal veins range in thickness from 0.1 to 4 m and can often be traced over distances of more than 750 m. Veins rarely occur alone; more often they form com- plicated networks with various crystallization sequences. The siliceous supercritical water pen- etrates surrounding rocks and quartz, cassiterite (SnO 2), and scheelite (CaWO 4) precipitate. Such so-called high-temperature pneumatolytic deposits have long been mined for tin in the Erzgebirge (at Zinnwald, now Cinovec in the Czech Repub- lic), and in Thailand, Malaysia, and Bolivia. Skarns are special types of plutonic hydrother- mal deposits that occur along contacts between granites and limestones or marbles. They form a polymineralic deposit of variable thickness (from 1--2 cm to hundreds of meters). The skarns are typically composed of calcsilicate minerals such as garnets, vesuvianite, epidote, diopside, and wollastonite. Skarns are metasomatic rocks that form at a depth of 3--7 km under the in\ufb02uence of hot supercritical solutions that are expelled from the magma after initial metamorphism. These solutions contain calcium and magnesium originating from the marbles, as well as silicon, aluminum, and sodium originating from the granites. Skarns are often important as a source of tungsten, tin, lead, zinc, copper, and beryl- lium ores. Skarn is an old Swedish miners\u2019 term meaning \u2018\u2018waste rock\u2019\u2019 because miners disposed of the skarn rock, extracting only the metal ore.

In the peripheral part of the deposit, silica minerals and hematite precipitate to form ferruginous chert composed of cryptocrystalline silica (after Evans, 1993). as sediments where hydrothermal systems vented onto the sea \ufb02oor as hot springs. The surface deposits are underlain by a system of feeder veins through which the solution reached the surface (Figure 24.12). The deposits are underlain by shal- low volcanic rocks that provided the heat and to some extent the hydrothermal water. There is a systematic evolution of mineral deposition with increasing temperature. First \u2018\u2018black ore\u2019\u2019 rich in sphalerite, galena, pyrite, and barite pre- cipitates as relatively cool (200 \u25e6C) hydrothermal solutions mixed with cold seawater. Subsequently hotter (300--350 \u25e6C) solutions replace the earlier deposited minerals with chalcopyrite in the lower part of the deposit (\u2018\u2018yellow ore\u2019\u2019). Still hotter, copper-undersaturated solutions dissolve some chalcopyrite to form pyrite-rich bases. During this whole process silica minerals and hematite pre- cipitate at the peripheral parts of the hydrother- mal system to form ferruginous chert. Ancient massive sul\ufb01de deposits have been mined for mil- lennia in Cyprus (which derives its name from the Greek word for copper, \u03ba\u00b4\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u00b4o\u03c3 (kypros), and large deposits are also found in Kuroko (northern Japan). Such mineral-forming processes are observed today along oceanic ridges. Pillars and cones, up to 50--100 m high, are composed of calcite, barite, anhydrite, and pyrrhotite. Black smoke emerges from the centers of the pillars (Figure 24.13a), and hence they have been given the name black smokers. The black smoke contains microscopic grains of pyrrhotite and amorphous silica, mixed with zinc and copper sul\ufb01des. If the smoke is white, it contains particles of amorphous silica, anhydrite, and barite. The associated steam has a pH of about 4, a temperature of 300--400 \u25e6C, and is", "page": 419}

A cross-section of a black smoker chimney from the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the northeast Paci\ufb01c Ocean displays a core with bacterial mats and clays, an interior zone with pyrite, spha- lerite, marcasite, and wurtzite, and exterior walls with barite, anhydrite, and amorphous silica (Figure 24.13b). Near black smokers, the sedi- ments become saturated with metals and trans- form to sul\ufb01des during diagenesis. Very active modern processes of sul\ufb01de precipitation have been observed at the bottom of the Red Sea. Hydrothermal-sedimentary deposits are generally telethermal, i.e., far removed from igneous activity. The deposits form simultaneously with sediment deposition and diagenesis and are gen- erally of low temperature (< 200 \u25e6C, epithermal). The composition of the pore water is changed by metal-rich solutions that penetrate into the sediments. As the sediments are buried they become compacted and recrystallize. Chemical reactions then cause precipitation of sul\ufb01de minerals. Depending on the composition of the hydrothermal solutions, stratiform deposits of copper, polymetallic lead--zinc--iron ores, and iron--manganese deposits may form. The hydrothermal solutions can have various origins, related to volcanic activity, plutonic intrusions, or metamorphic processes. Stratiform deposits are the most common sources for copper, lead, and zinc. They occur in shales, sandstones, and carbonate rocks. Sul\ufb01des comprise the intergranular space of sedimentary and volcanoclastic rocks, forming layered lenses and beds of sul\ufb01des within those rocks. A charac- teristic feature of stratiform ores is the relatively simple mineral assemblage with pyrite, chalcopy- rite, bornite, chalcocite, galena, and sphalerite, impregnating the host sedimentary rocks as \ufb01ne-grained dispersions and veinlets. Stratiform ore deposits show great areal extent, and even those with low concentrations constitute large reserves. An example is the Mississippi Valley- type lead--zinc deposit, where basinal brines precipitate dissolved elements in their \ufb02ow path. Large sedimentary copper deposits are the Kupferschiefer shale that underlies an area of 20 000 km 2, extending from northern England to Poland; the White Pine shale in Michigan (USA); and the African Copper Belt extending from the southern region of the Democratic Re- public of the Congo to northern Zambia, where copper-mineralization is up to 100 m thick. In the so-called Keweenaw-type deposits (named after the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan) native copper and silver \ufb01ll vesicles and pores in submarine basalts and conglomerates. There are some mesothermal ( >250 \u25e6C) sedi- mentary deposits that formed at deeper crustal levels. The greenstone-hosted hydrothermal sys- tem of the Mother Lode in California (USA) orig- inated at depths of up to 10 km. Waters were released at a late stage of the intrusion of the Sierra Nevada batholith, while subduction and thrusting stacked plates of the upper crust on top of one another. Gold is concentrated in iron-rich wall rocks, rather than the veins themselves and was deposited when gold--sulfur ions in solution reacted to form iron sul\ufb01de minerals, predom- inantly pyrite, removing sulfur from the com- plex ions. The Mother Lode system in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California is an extensive, over 200 km", "page": 421}

Three agents are involved: oxygen, electrochemi- cal processes, and bacteria. Oxidation occurs in that part of an ore deposit that is above a certain oxygen threshold.

Sul\ufb01de minerals in contact can act as a galvanic micro-cell, causing decomposition along grain boundaries. Here the anode is sphalerite (ZnS) and the cathode is pyrite (FeS 2). Electrochemical processes take place if sul\ufb01de minerals are in contact in a damp environment. A pair of grains, such as pyrite and sphalerite (Figure 24.14), acts like a galvanic micro-cell. With the two minerals in contact with an acidic aqueous solution, we can write two dissociation reactions: (a) ZnS \u21cc Zn2+ + S + 2e\u2212 (b) FeS2 + 2e\u2212 \u21cc Fe + 2S\u2212 The standard redox potentials (see Chapter 17) for these reactions are E (a) 0 =+ 0.12 V and E (b) 0 = +0.50 V, respectively. ZnS is the electron donor, and thus the anode, while pyrite is the cathode. There is an electrical current \ufb02owing between the two minerals, and they are decomposing along grain boundaries, the initial electromotive force being 0.38V. Biochemical processes can contribute to oxida- tion. The concentration of bacteria in surface solutions can reach over 100 cells per milliliter of solution or per gram of ore. A living bac- terial cell is an active electron acceptor be- cause biochemical processes inside it operate more ef\ufb01ciently when these electrons are ac- cepted. A redox potential exists between an in- ner part and the surface of a bacterial cell, which thus can play the role of an active ox- idizing agent. The electromotive force in gal- vanic mineral micro-cells reaches a maximum (0.60--0.65 V) only when bacteria take part in the oxidation process. Bacteria of the genus Thiobacil- lus are especially active and oxidize many sul\ufb01de minerals. These combined electrochemical and bio- chemical processes lead to the formation of ox- idized ores above primary sul\ufb01de deposit, and the oxidized zones can range in thickness from a fraction of a meter to hundreds of meters, depending on local factors such as climate, re- lief, groundwater level, fracturing, and compo- sition of the original ore. In Tsumeb (Namibia) such oxidation zones are exceptionally large and extend to a depth of several hundred meters. Oxidation zones have been used as prospecting tools. The ferrous ochers (yellow), copper oxides, and carbonates (green and blue) are easily rec- ognized on the surface. Oxidation zones often concentrate metals and can be important sec- ondary deposits. Industrially valuable concentra- tions of copper, zinc, and lead occur in such secondary deposits.

{"text": "Chapter 25 Oxides and hydroxides. Review of ionic crystals Introduction The oxide and hydroxide groups each include about 200 minerals, or about 10% of all min- eral species. We have discussed quartz and other silica minerals in Chapter 19. Quartz comprises nearly 12 vol.% of the earth\u2019s crust. Another oxide that is just as important as quartz is crystalline H 2O (ice). This mineral occurs only as a \u2018\u2018sea- sonal\u2019\u2019 phase at moderate latitudes, forms polar ice shields (crucial for the earth\u2019s climate), and glaciers. Besides its occurrence on the earth\u2019s sur- face, ice is one of the two major minerals build- ing up the polar caps on Mars and has recently been documented on the moon. It is also found as particles forming the rings around Saturn, and may form a large part of the composition of some satellites of Saturn, Jupiter, and Uranus. Another important oxide is CO 2, which does not occur on earth in the solid state but is present as a mineral on Mars and on the satellites of the outer plan- ets, as well as in meteorites. In contrast to quartz and ice, iron oxides and hydroxides contribute only about 0.2% to the crust of the earth, but the minerals magnetite (Fe 3O4) and hematite (Fe 2O3) are the two major constituents of iron ores, and without iron the present state of our civilization is unimaginable. More than 40 elements are found in nature in the form of oxides. Mainly, these are metals and transition elements, but some nonmetallic elements such as silicon (quartz, SiO 2), arsenic (arsenolite, As2O3), and antimony (senarmontite, Sb2O3) form oxide minerals. The chemical compo- sition of hydroxides is less diverse. Approximately 25 elements occur in nature as hydroxides. Alu- minum, manganese, and uranium are the most signi\ufb01cant of these. Both oxides and hydroxides can be subdivided into two types: simple and complex. The \ufb01rst group includes those mineral species with a sin- gle element as a cation. Periclase (MgO), corun- dum (Al 2O3), gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), and manganite (Mn2+ Mn4+ O2(OH)2) are examples. Complex ox- ides and hydroxides contain two or more main elements, such as in spinel (MgAl 2O4) and per- ovskite (CaTiO3). Immediately after X-ray diffraction was dis- covered, the new technique was applied to de- termine the crystal structure of oxides and hy- droxides, and this research served as the basis for the development of crystal chemistry. By 1915 the structure of spinel had been determined, fol- l o w e di n1 9 1 6b yt h o s eo fr u t i l e( T i O 2), anatase (TiO2), and corundum, in 1919 by that of brucite (Mg(OH)2), and in 1920 by that of periclase. These ionic structures became models for such prin- ciples as close-packing of anions and helped to establish the basic rules of ionic structures for- mulated in the Pauling rules and discussed in Chapter 2. Later the more complex structures goethite (FeOOH), gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (AlOOH), diaspore", "page": 424}

{"text": "IONIC CRYSTAL STRUCTURES 407 The major oxides and some of their properties are listed in Table 25.1, and the same is done for hydroxides in Table 25.2. Oxides are important ceramic materials, syn- thesized for many applications. Alumina (Al 2O3), zirconia (ZrO 2), magnesia (MgO), and spinel are important \u2018\u2018structural ceramics\u2019\u2019. Because of their outstanding high-temperature strength and low density, oxides have recently been applied in the manufacture of car engines and turbine blades. Other \u2018\u2018functional ceramics\u2019\u2019 are used be- cause of unique electronic properties. Perovskites are known for their ferroelectric and high- temperature superconducting properties and are components of actuators, sensors, and other elec- tronic devices. Ionic crystal structures As we have gone through the mineral groups in the previous chapters we have encountered most of the basic ionic structure types. Before advanc- ing to the structurally more complex silicates it is appropriate to look back and review the princi- ples of bonding and coordination and to summa- rize the most important ionic structures. Oxides are a good mineral group with which to under- take such a review: bonding in oxides is largely ionic and for practically all types of ionic struc- tures there are oxide examples, although we will add a few sul\ufb01des because there are better-known sul\ufb01de minerals for some types of ionic struc- tures. The structures we will discuss here are a minimal set that every student should remember after having taken a class in mineralogy. Before starting this discussion it is useful to clarify the difference between mineral and structure. A structure refers to the atomic ar- rangement of atoms in the unit cell. Structures are often named after the mineral in which they have \ufb01rst been discovered, particularly so for simple structures. The \ufb01rst structure deter- mination was done by W. L. Bragg on halite (NaCl) (see Chapter 7). Thus this cubic structure with alternating cations and anions is called the \u2018\u2018halite structure\u201d. It also applies to galena (PbS), periclase (MgO) and others. Similarly, in this chapter we will talk about spinels and perovskites. The spinel mineral is MgAl 2O4 but there are many other minerals and compounds with the same structure yet different composi- tion. Compounds such as chromite (FeCr 2O4)a r e often referred to as \u2018\u2018spinels\u201d, though this usage is mineralogically not quite correct. The same ap- plies to perovskites. The relatively rare perovskite mineral is CaTiO 3, but perovskite structures are numerous. According to the principles derived by V.M. Goldschmidt and L. Pauling (see Chapter 2), several rules must be followed. (1) Anions are rel- atively closely packed; in many cases in outright cubic or hexagonal close-packing. (2) Even if not ideally close-packed, anions form regular coor- dination polyhedra about cations (tetrahedra, octahedra, cubes, and dodecahedra), i.e., they surround them in a close-packed arrangement and the coordination polyhedra are linked. (3) Cations are generally smaller and occupy inter- stices in the anion sublattice. Small cations (e.g., Si 4+) occupy tetrahedral interstices (coordination number 4), medium-sized ones (Al 3+,M g 2+,", "page": 425}
{"text": "Fe2+) occupy octahedral interstices (coordina- tion number 6), and large ones (Ca 2+)a r ei n cubic (coordination number 8) or cuboctahedral (coordination number 12) interstices. Let us \ufb01rst consider simple ionic compounds of the type A--X, where A stands for the cation and X for the anion. We can write a simple matrix for the types of close-packing (cubic or hexagonal) and occupied interstices (octahedral or tetrahe- dral) to arrive at the four most important crys- tal structures, each with some mineral examples (Figure 25.1, Table 25.3). The importance of these four simple ionic structures cannot be overem- phasized: of all known ionic A--X compounds, over 60% crystallize in the halite structure (Fig- ure 25.1a), 15% in the nickeline structure (Figure 25.1b), and 10% in the sphalerite structure (Fig- ure 25.1c). The wurtzite structure (Figure 25.1d) is more rare. The four structure types highlighted in Table 25.3 cannot accommodate very large cations. For this purpose the CsCl structure (not a mineral) is better suited: the anions are in a simple cubic lattice with the cations in the center of the cubes (Figure 25.2), and the coordination number is 8.", "page": 425}

Only one oxygen ion layer is shown. Hexagonal unit cell is outlined. Twenty percent of A--X compounds are in the CsCl structure. The concept of close-packing applies also to many ionic structures of a more complicated type A nBmXp. For example in corundum (Al 2O3) and isotructural hematite (Fe 2O3), and ilmenite (FeTiO3), the oxygen ions display hexagonal close- packing and cations are in two thirds of the oc- tahedral interstices (Figure 25.3). In cubic spinel (MgAl 2O4), the oxygen close-packing is cubic and the close-packed plane is (111). Interstices are occupied by Mg 2+ and Al 3+. Interestingly, and contrary to the conventional rule of radius ra- tio, the usually larger magnesium cations occupy smaller tetrahedral sites (here, the Mg 2+ radius is about 0.49 \u02daA as compared with 0.72--0.89 \u02daAi n most minerals), whereas aluminum is accommo- dated in octahedral sites (with an ionic radius of about 0.53 \u02daA) (Figure 25.4a). Therefore, close oxygen packing in spinel is not ideal, and tetra- hedral and octahedral polyhedra are deformed somewhat in this structure.

An interesting derivative of a close-packed structure is perovskite (CaTiO 3). Oxygen within the perovskite structure is in a cubic close-packed arrangement (i.e., fcc), except that in every second layer one oxygen ion is missing, leaving a large cavity (in the center of Figure 25.5a). Ti 4+ oc- cupies octahedral interstices, and the large Ca 2+ cation occupies the cavity left vacant by the miss- ing oxygen ion. This site is coordinated by 12 oxy- gen ions (Figure 25.5b). The perovskite structure is unique among the close-packed oxides in its ability to accommodate very large cations such as the rare earth elements.

(The oxide CO2 is of course not an ionic structure and simply added because of the structural analogy). If the 12-fold coordinated cation is smaller than oxygen, the structure becomes distorted by the tilting of octahedra, particularly at lower temperatures, giving rise to many phase transfor- mations. The modi\ufb01ed structure may be tetrago- nal, orthorhombic, or monoclinic, in some cases without a center of symmetry (Figure 25.5c). Non- centric perovskites may display piezoelectricity or ferroelectricity, and synthetic perovskites are applied as electronic sensors. The structure of the newly discovered high-temperature superconduc- tors (HTC) is closely related to that of perovskites. In these superconductors Cu substitutes for Ti in layers that display an unusual superconductivity at high temperature. Some examples of natural and synthetic perovskites are given in Table 25.5. Some other structures are easier to visualize if the cation packing is considered. For example, the structures of such unlike oxides as molec- ular CO 2 (Figure 25.6a) and ionic ZrO 2 (badde- lyite, Figure 25.6b) can be viewed as cubic close packing of carbon and zirconium. Even the more open structure of cristobalite (SiO 2), which has been discussed in Chapter 19 as consisting of rings of tetrahedra, can be viewed as silicon in an fcc arrangement with additional silicon atoms in alternating one eighth cubes (Figure 25.6c). In fact, cation packing has been suggested as an al- ternative system for classifying ionic structures (O\u2019Keefe and Hyde, 1985).", "page": 431}

The structures discussed above have an equal or similar number of cations and anions. We re- lied mainly on the concept of close-packing of large anions with small cations in interstices. Also in these structures, each cation is sur- rounded by anions with the geometry of co- ordination polyhedra, but these are very densely packed and share faces. It would be dif\ufb01cult to build a model of the halite structure with poly- hedra because it would consist of two sets of edge- sharing octahedra. Other oxides, particularly those with a larger anion:cation ratio, are more open, and their polyhedra share only edges or corners. These are so-called polyhedral structures. We have already discussed silica minerals with polyhedral structures of SiO 4\u2212 4 tetrahedra connected by corners, and we will return to re- lated structures in Chapters 26--29 on silicates. As was pointed out in Chapter 2, if these tetrahe- dra shared faces, cations would be in too close a proximity for the structure to be stable.

Between the ribbons there are in\ufb01nite \u2018\u2018channels\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018tunnels\u2019\u2019 that are visible when the structure is viewed along the c-axis (Figure 25.7c) or in a polyhedral represen- tation (Figure 25.8a). Cassiterite (SnO 2), pyrolusite (MnO2), and stishovite (SiO2) have structures sim- ilar to that of rutile. There are numerous channel structures in manganese oxides that can be thought of as derivatives of the rutile structure. Pyrolusite (Mn 4+O2) is isostructural with rutile (Figure 25.8a). In ramsdellite (Mn 4+O2), two ribbons are joined by sharing edges to form a band and then stacked in a planar arrangement (Figure 25.8b). In hollandite (Ba(Mn 2+,M n4+)8O16), bands of two oc- tahedra alternate with a horizontal and vertical stacking, resulting in larger tunnels that can ac- commodate large cations such as barium (Figure 25.8c). In romanechite (BaMn 2+Mn4+ 9 O20\u00b7H2O), bands of two and three ribbons alternate with a horizontal and vertical stacking (Figure 25.8d). This creates tunnels that are wide enough to ac- commodate water molecules. As you can imag- ine, there is some stacking disorder among these types, with intermediate or mixed arrangements in local regions. The structural variations are ex- pressed in differences of cation--cation distances (within layers versus between adjacent layers) and can be used for identifying the minerals, for ex- ample by EXAFS spectrometry (see Figure 12.31). It is worth pointing out again that, in stishovite, silicon is in octahedral coordination, whereas in all other silica minerals silicon is in tetrahedral coordination. Stishovite is the high- pressure polymorph of SiO 2, and at extreme pres- sures O2\u2212 deviates from a spherical shape and can be packed more closely around Si 4+ with 6-fold coordination. Note that also in high-pressure per- ovskite (MgSiO 3), Si 4+ is in octahedral coordina- tion. In brucite (Mg(OH)2) and gibbsite (Al(OH)3), oc- tahedra in which OH \u2212 groups rather than O 2\u2212 form corners, are connected to in\ufb01nite stacked sheets (Figure 25.9).

Brief description of important oxide minerals Cuprite (Cu2O) is a cubic mineral that sometimes forms perfect octahedra with an adamantine lus- ter on its faces (Plate 14d). More often, however, it occurs as compact granular aggregates with a metal-like and greasy luster. Typically it has a deep cherry-red color. Cleavage is seen in some cases. Cuprite\u2019s streak is brick-brown, but it be- comes dark brown or green upon \ufb01ner grinding. The latter feature helps to distinguish this min- eral from iron oxides and hydroxides. Cuprite is often associated with native copper, malachite, and azurite. It is an intermediate oxidation prod- uct of chalcopyrite and other copper sul\ufb01de ores. Trigonal (rhombohedral) corundum (Al 2O3), called \u2018\u2018alumina\u201d in the ceramics \ufb01eld, often contains minor amounts of chromium, tita- nium, and iron. Strong ionic--covalent bonds are expressed in its high hardness (Mohs\u2019 scale 9) and the close-packed structure results in a high density (4.0 g/cm 3, close to the density of chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2,), which contains much heavier elements). Euhedral crystals of corundum display a com- bination of steep hexagonal bipyramid faces (which almost always have rough horizontal stri- ations) and faces of a pinacoid (0001). The relative dominance of the two forms depends on the com- position and the mineral-forming environment. The less silicon and the more alkali and alkali-- earth metals corundum contains, the more elon- gate are its crystals. Besides being found as iso- lated crystals within a rock, corundum occurs also as massive granular aggregates known as emery. Corundum\u2019s color is white or gray if it is pure Al 2O3,b u ti ti sruby -red if some chromium is present (Plate 13b), sapphire-blue if it contains iron and titanium (Plate 13c,d), and yellow if only iron is present. Corundum has a vitreous luster. In thin section, it displays a blue-white pleochroism. Corundum forms during hydrothermal al- teration of volcanic and ultrama\ufb01c rocks, under regional metamorphism of alumina- rich clays and bauxites, and in alkaline mag- mas that are alumina-supersaturated and silica- undersaturated. The latter mode is responsible for the formation of nepheline syenites and syen- ite pegmatites, with dispersions of sapphire-like corundum crystals. This mineral accumulates easily in placers. Corundum is used as a gem- stone (ruby and sapphire) and as an industrial abrasive material. The high hardness, crystal habit, and color of the mineral serve as easy means of identi\ufb01cation. Corundum and quartz never coexist owing to the following reaction: Al2O3 + SiO2 \u2192 Al2SiO5 (kyanite, sillimanite, andalusite) Hematite (Fe3+ 2 O3) is isostructural with corun- dum. Crystals occur as hexagonal plates (Figure 25.11a) or as more complex tabular forms (see Fig- ure 5.21b). Frequently it is found as earthy and irregular masses called red iron ore. The mineral has a black color and a semi-metallic luster when found as crystals. Earthy and botryoidal masses (Plate 13e) are bright brick red with a vitreous or dull luster.

The most typical hematite deposits are in quartz veins; in skarns, where hematite is as- sociated with epidote and quartz; in quartzites, schists, and other regional-metamorphic rocks; in oxidation zones of iron ores; and in laterites, where hematite is the most stable iron compound existing in an arid climate. Hematite is a major iron ore. For purposes of identi\ufb01cation, hematite is rec- ognized easily by its red streak. Ilmenite (FeTiO 3) has the same structure as corundum and hematite (Figure 25.3), but its cations are ordered in alternate layers parallel to the close-packed oxygen atoms. It occurs as tabular and platy crystals of black color with metallic luster. The streak is black. Sometimes ilmenite has weak magnetic properties. Its hard- ness is about 5.5.

Ilmenite may be mistaken for magnetite, but differs in crystal morphology and has less pro- nounced magnetic properties. Periclase (MgO) is isostructural with halite (\u2018\u2018magnesia\u2019\u2019). It is only rarely found on the sur- face of the earth but is likely to be a major com- ponent of the lower mantle, as we will see later. In spinel (MgAl 2O4) isomorphic substitutions of Fe2+,F e3+,M n2+,C r2+, and Zn 2+ cause a vari- ety of colors. Ideally, pure magnesium aluminum oxide is colorless, but chromium produces pink or red color, and iron green, greenish-black, or blue color (depending on the total iron content and on the Fe 2+:Fe3+ ratio). The luster is vitreous. The crystal habit and high hardness (8) serve in the identi\ufb01cation of the mineral. Spinel forms at high temperature and pres- sure conditions. It occurs in metamorphic rocks rich in magnesium, such as marbles and calcsil- icates, owing to metamorphism of clay-rich car- bonates. It also occurs in metasomatic calcsili- cate rocks interbedded in Archean gneisses and schists. The mineral assemblage of all these de- posits is very speci\ufb01c and includes calcite, diop- side, forsterite, and phlogopite. Magnetite (Fe 2+Fe3+ 2 O4) is a major iron ore. It has a very complex composition owing to iso- morphous substitutions of titanium (titanomag- netite), aluminum, magnesium, chromium, vana- dium, manganese, and silicon, among others. Therefore the iron content may vary consider- ably. This compositional complexity and the dis- tribution of the various cations among struc- turally nonequivalent positions are the causes of phase transformations at low temperature. Hav- ing crystallized at high temperatures as a homo- geneous phase, magnetite undergoes exsolution into a mixture of mineral phases such as mag- netite (chemically more pure), ilmenite, spinel, ulvite, and others. Magnetite is found as euhedral octahedral crystals (Plate 14a) (rarely as dodecahedra), as granular aggregates, and as veinlets. The min- eral is black, has a semimetallic or metallic lus- ter, and exhibits pronounced magnetic proper- ties that vary depending on its composition.

Distinctive color, streak, luster, and strong magnetism provide for easy identi\ufb01cation of this mineral. Magnetite occurs in many geological envi- ronments. Economically important magnetite deposits are found as dispersions in olivinites, peridotites, and gabbros, or as skarns. In these deposits, magnetite has formed owing partly to the addition of iron to solutions and partly to the r e l e a s eo fi r o nf r o me a r l y - f o r m e di r o n - b e a r i n g skarn minerals such as hedenbergite and andra- dite, which in turn react with solutions. Other magnetite deposits are iron quartzites (metamor- phic rocks), in which magnetite has formed by partial reduction of iron and by mineral trans- formations in primary volcanic and sedimentary rocks during high-grade metamorphism. When subjected to weathering, magnetite oxidizes and causes hematite and goethite to form.

This mineral is black or brownish-black in color with a greasy or metal-like luster. The brown, dark- brown, or greenish-brown streak is characteris- tic of chromite. The hardness ranges from 5.5 to 7, increasing with the chromium content. Weak magnetism is sometimes observed. Chromite is the only ore mineral of chromium. Important deposits are located in South Africa (Bushveld complex) and Zimbabwe (Great Dyke). Identifying chromite can be dif\ufb01cult because it has many similarities to magnetite. Chromite is almost always nonmagnetic or weakly mag- netic; its streak is not black, but dirty brown or greenish-brown. The frequent association of the mineral with yellow and green masses of ser- pentine, with emerald-green crystals and grains of uvarovite, and with pinkish-violet coatings of chromian chlorites helps in the identi\ufb01cation. Ringwoodite (Mg 2SiO4) with spinel structure, forms when olivine is subjected to high pressure. It occurs in some meteorites and is thought to be one of the major phases in the earth\u2019s inter- mediate mantle (\u2018\u2018transition zone\u2019\u2019). At very high pressures its polyhedral sites are distorted and the cation:anion radius ratio rule discussed in Chapter 2 no longer applies. Rutile (TiO 2) usually forms prismatic and acicular crystals that often have well-developed faces (tetragonal--bipyramidal and prismatic) (Plate 14c). Rutile is black or reddish-brown in color and has a pale brownish streak and an adamantine luster. Prismatic cleavage is characteristic. The mineral is often found in quartz veins in meta- morphic rocks. In such veins rutile forms spec- tacular acicular inclusions in quartz. The mineral accumulates in placers and is used as a titanium ore. Anatase (TiO 2) is rare and found as isolated bluish-black tetragonal--bipyramidal crystals in quartz veins and \ufb01ssures in metamorphic rocks.", "page": 437}

The mineral has a high density between 6.8 and 7.0 g/cm 3. Cas- siterite\u2019s color is red, brown, or brownish-black, and the streak is generally colorless or yellow- white. Cassiterite occurs in granite pegmatites, greisens, high-temperature hydrothermal veins, and skarns (see Chapter 24). It accumulates also in marine placers. The mineral is mined from all these deposits as a tin ore. Cassiterite can be recognized easily by its crystal morphology and by a combination of three extreme properties: very high hardness, very high density, and very strong luster. If the mineral is \ufb01ne grained, identi\ufb01cation is dif\ufb01- cult and the so-called tin-mirror reaction may help. In this reaction cassiterite becomes covered with shiny metallic tin when placed on a heated zinc plate and treated with diluted hydrochloric acid.

The hexavalent ura- nium occupies U 4+ sites in the structure. The U4+ may be substituted by, among others, tho- rium, cerium, and lead, sometimes in signi\ufb01cant amounts. It has black color, displays a resinous luster, and it is strongly radioactive. Uraninite is found in uranium-bearing skarns, in granites, in granite pegmatites as black cube- like crystals, and in uranium-bearing medium- temperature hydrothermal veins as kidney- shaped (Figure 25.11b) and radiaxial aggregates. Uraninite is mined as an ore for uranium, tho- rium, radium, and rare earth elements. Red, or- ange, or bright-yellow \ufb01ne-grained mixtures of secondary uranium minerals often replace urani- nite. These have a glue-like appearance, consist of uranium hydroxides, carbonates, silicates, and phosphates; and are referred to as \u2018\u2018gummites\u2019\u2019. Minerals of the \u2018\u2018 perovskite group\u2019\u2019 include per- ovskite (CaTiO 3) and its compositional varieties, including loparite, that may contain up to 15% Nb2O5 and 0.7% Ta2O5. The perovskite group min- erals show extensive isomorphic substitutions of the rare-earth elements, thorium, and uranium, for calcium by schemes such as the following: (a) Ca 2+ + Ca2+\u21cc Ce3+ + Na+ (b) Ca2+ + Ti4+\u21cc Ce3+ + Fe3+ (c) Ca2+ + Ti4+\u21cc Na+ + (Nb,Ta)5+ (d) Ca2+ + Ca2+ + Ti4+\u21cc Th4+ + Na+ + Fe3+ (e) Ca2+ + Ca2+ + Ti4+\u21cc U4+ + Na+ + Fe3+ As a result, a general formula for perovskite is (Ca, Ce, Na, Th, U)(Ti, Nb, Ta, Fe)O 3. Perovskite crystals are cubic or cube- octahedral in habit (Plate 14c); loparite forms star-like interpenetration twins of cubic crystals (Figure 25.11c). Perovskite has a resinous luster, a hardness of 5.5--6, and a weak-colored, gray-white streak. These minerals occur almost exclusively in massifs of alkaline nepheline-bearing rocks, such as nepheline syenites, alkaline pyroxenites, and nepheline-bearing pegmatites, where they form scarce disseminated black grains. Alkaline pyroxenites of some of the massifs host large masses of \ufb01ne-grained \u2018\u2018\ufb01sh-roe\u2019\u2019-like perovskite that comprise up to 80--90% of the rock (an ex- ample is in the Afrikanda deposit on the Kola Peninsula, Russia). Perovskite minerals are also found in carbonatites. Perovskite accumulations are not used as a source for titanium because the isomorphic cerium and niobium lessen the quality of the titanium extracted from such an ore. Loparite- bearing nepheline syenites are mined as a tanta- lum ore. Neither perovskite nor loparite are easy to identify. Unlike magnetite, perovskite is not magnetic and has a pale streak.

Some have very useful ferroelectric properties that are applied in electronic devices. The perovskite structure has received a lot of attention because of its con- nection to high-temperature superconductivity in compounds such as YBa 2Cu3O6.

Only a few pyrochlores exhibit a strong adamantine luster. Their color is yellow, brown, or black. This min- eral is often radioactive. Pyrochlore forms in alkaline (nepheline syen- ite) pegmatites, in calcite veins within nepheline syenite intrusions, and in carbonatites. Py- rochlore ores are mined for niobium, tantalum, uranium, and rare-earth elements. Brief description of important hydroxide minerals Brucite (Mg(OH)2) forms colorless platy crystals with hexagonal shape. This mineral is relatively rare, and it crystallizes as one of the products of hydrothermal alteration of ultrama\ufb01c rocks and in some marbles, replacing olivine. Brucite is found in \ufb01ne-grained masses, in crystals, and sometimes in parallel-acicular aggregates. The most common aluminum hydroxides are gibbsite (Al(OH) 3) diaspore (AlOOH) and boehmite (AlOOH). The structural features with chains and tunnels parallel to the c-axis (see Figure 25.10) are expressed in the crystal morphology of boehmite and diaspore: crystals are elongate-platy in habit, as can be seen with an electron microscope. Since hydrogen bonds play a role in the structures of boehmite and diaspore, these minerals are harder than gibbsite, which has no such bonds. Aluminum hydroxides rarely occur as indi- vidual grains. More often they associate with each other, with iron hydroxides and oxides, and with kaolinite to form bauxites (named af- ter their occurrence at Les Baux, in Provence, France). The bauxites are compact \ufb01ne-grained ag- gregates, loose or clay-like masses that often have oolitic texture. Their color is white, gray, red, or dark red. Bauxites form as a product of sur\ufb01cial weathering of granites in a tropical or subtrop- ical climate. (Bauxites in France are of Eocene age, when the climate was very different from what it is today). Genetically bauxites resemble laterites, but the latter form by weathering of ultrama\ufb01c and ma\ufb01c rocks and thus are poorer in aluminum hydroxides. The bauxites are a ma- jor source of aluminum and alumina, the latter a raw material used for manufacturing ceramics and cement. Gibbsite and diaspore only rarely form crys- tals. Those of gibbsite are colorless hexagonal platelets with a perfect (001) cleavage and occur together with other products of hydrothermal alteration of nepheline. Diaspore is found as platy crystals with a rough striation and a strong pearly luster in metamorphic deposits. It has a hardness between 6 and 7. Iron hydroxide minerals rarely occur as individ- ual crystals. Goldish-brown needles of goethite (Fe 3+OOH) (see Figure 5.20, Plate 13f ) occur with quartz inside quartz-chalcedony amygdules in volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Lepidochrocite (Fe 3+OOH) forms as goldish-brass-yellow mica- ceous coatings on hematite and other oxidized iron ores. More frequently, these minerals form part of mixtures known as brown iron ore or limonite. Such mixtures are found as rusty- brown to black, earthy, kidney-shaped, \ufb01ne- grained aggregates (often pseudomorphic after pyrite, hematite, and other minerals), and as oo- lites.

The manganese in these minerals can display different valencies, and thus there is variability in the composition of the romanechite group. The romanechite group minerals occur as dark-brownish-black, brownish-black, or black powdery loose masses, or kidney-shaped aggre- gates, oolites, concretions, and dendrites. They have a powdery black or brownish-black streak. The romanechite minerals form in sedimentary rocks and in the oxidation zones of manganese- rich ores. Like most manganese oxides, they are used as a manganese ore. Recently formed iron--manganese concre- tions from the ocean \ufb02oor usually show very complex modal and chemical compositions that may differ from one part of a concretion to another. Iron is concentrated in the form of hydroxides. The manganese has a different valency and is represented by oxides such as pyrolusite and hollandite (BaMn 2+Mn4+ 7 O16) with Mn4+, and by numerous poorly crystallized hydroxides such as romanechite, todoro- kite ((Mn2+, Ca, Mg)Mn 4+ 3 O7\u00b7H2O), and birnessite Na(Mn4+ 3 Mn3+)O8\u00b73H2O. Nonferrous metals play a role as ion-exchange cations in some hydrox- ides of complex layered or tunnel structures. Frequently the concretions also include some \ufb01ne-grained quartz, clay minerals, and zeolites. The iron--manganese concretions are a potential source for the extraction of nonferrous metals. Although the latter are present in small quan- tities (1--1.5% Cu; 1--1.5% Ni; about 0.2% Co) the economic importance is signi\ufb01cant because the reserves are very large. Manganite (MnOOH) is often associated with other manganese hydroxides formed by mete- oric water and in low-temperature hydrothermal veins. It frequently alters to pyrolusite.

{"text": "Chapter 26 Orthosilicates and ring silicates. Metamorphic mineral assemblages General comments on silicates Silicate minerals constitute over 90 vol.% of the earth\u2019s crust and are thus the most common minerals that we encounter. Like other ionic compounds, silicate structures are built up of coordination polyhedra, mainly tetrahedra and octahedra. Among the elements in the crust, oxy- gen (47 atomic%), silicon (28%), aluminum (8%), iron (5%), and calcium (4%) are the most abun- dant, and therefore minerals containing silica in combination with these other elements dom- inate. We have already discussed some silicate minerals in Chapter 19, namely feldspars and sil- ica minerals. In the next four chapters we take a closer look at the large variety of silicates and their signi\ufb01cance as rock-forming minerals. The Si---O bond is only about half ionic, while the remainder is covalent. The covalent Si 3 p 3---O 2p hybrid bonds (Figure 26.1) have directional properties, contrary to the spherical symmetry of electrostatic attraction in ionic bonding. Be- cause of this, silicates in general have low crystal symmetry, a high anisotropy of physical proper- ties and a complex crystal structure with large unit cells. The bonds de\ufb01ne a coordination tetra- hedron SiO 4\u2212 4 , which is the basic building unit of silicate minerals (see also Figure 19.2). There are several important cation substitu- tions in silicates, on tetrahedral, octahedral and larger structural sites (Table 26.1). It is signi\ufb01- cant that some of these substitutions are between ions of different charge. Because of the required overall electrostatic neutrality, it may be neces- sary to have coupled substitutions such as in plagioclase feldspar, as we have seen in Chapter 19, i.e., (Ca2+ \u21cc Na+) (Al3+ \u21cc Si4+) AlSi2O8 Aluminum, with a radius ratiorAl:rO = 0.43, is close to the limit between octahedral and tetra- hedral coordination (0.414) and can substitute ei- ther for tetrahedral silicon or for octahedral ions. This is one of the reasons for the tremendous va- riety of silicate structures. Silicates with all Al 3+ in tetrahedral coordination are called alumosil- icates, and examples include all feldspars such as microcline (KAl IVSi3O8, the roman superscript is used to indicate the coordination number), and the zeolites such as heulandite (CaAl IV 2 Si7O18\u00b7 nH2O). Other silicates have at least some alu- minum in octahedral coordination and those are called aluminosilicates. Among them are topaz (AlVI 2 (SiO4)F2), grossular (Ca 3AlVI 2 (SiO4)3), mus- covite (KAl VI 2 (AlIVSi3O10)(OH)2), kyanite (Al VI 2 SiO5) and sillimanite (Al VIAlIVSiO5). In order to classify the 150 different silicate structures that are known to date, various sys- tems have been designed. Because of frequent substitutions, a rigorous chemical classification has failed. For example, take the magnesium sili- cates olivine (Mg 2SiO4), enstatite (MgSiO 3), and talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2). All contain only Mg 2+ and Si2+ as cations and one would expect similari- ties, yet the three minerals have entirely different morphologies and properties. The same is true for the magnesium--calcium silicates monticellite (CaMgSiO 4), akermanite (Ca 2MgSi2O7), and diop-", "page": 442}

It is dif\ufb01cult to distinguish olivine from monticellite, or en- statite from diopside. The reason is that the two pairs have very similar crystal structures. There- fore, a structural classi\ufb01cation has been intro- duced that groups silicates based on structure rather than composition. For example, minerals such as enstatite, jadeite (NaAlSi 2O6), and spo- dumene (LiAlSi 2O6), with little chemical resem- blance, all belong to the group chain silicates, or more speci\ufb01cally, pyroxenes. A structural classi\ufb01- cation is universally applied to silicates. For the structural classi\ufb01cation of silicates, however, the system for ionic structures, reviewed in Chapter 25, is not very appropriate. That sys- tem relied on the concept of close-packing of an- ions with cations in interstices. There are only a few silicate minerals with anions that are more or less close-packed. A natural grouping is based on silicon tetrahedra and their linkage. Each oxy- gen in a tetrahedron, such as those in Figure 26.1a, may share electrons with another tetrahe- dron, establishing linkages. This linking of tetra- h e d r ai sa l s or e f e r r e dt oa spolymerization,at e r m borrowed from organic chemistry. A structural classi\ufb01cation that primarily em- phasizes the linkage of SiO 4\u2212 4 tetrahedra is used in most modern descriptions of silicates. Tetrahedra are either isolated SiO 4\u2212 4 as in olivine (Figure 26.2a), or form groups of two with two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen Si 2O6\u2212 7 (e.g., lawsonite (Ca 2Al2Si2O7(OH)2\u00b7H2O), Figure 26.2b) in orthosilicates.I nring silicates tetrahe- dra combine to form rings of three Si 3O6\u2212 9 (e.g., benitoite (BaTiSi 3O9)), four Si 4O8\u2212 12 (e.g., ax- inite (Ca2Fe2+Al2OHBO3Si4O12)), or six tetrahedra Si6O12\u2212 18 (e.g., beryl (Be 3Al2Si6O18), Figure 26.2c) and two corners of each tetrahedron are shared. In chain silicates the tetrahedra are linked to form in\ufb01nite chains, with either single chains with units Si 2O4\u2212 6 , as in diopside (CaMgSi 2O6) (Fig- ure 26.2d), or double chains, with units Si 4O6\u2212 11 , as in hornblende ((Na, K) 0\u22121(Ca, Na) 2 (Mg, Fe 2+) (Al,Fe3+)S i7AlO22(OH)2) (Figure 26.2e). In sheet sil- icates, such as mica, the tetrahedra form hexag- onal sheets in which three corners of the tetra- hedra are shared and the free corners all point in the same direction. The unit is Si 2O2\u2212 5 as in muscovite (Figure 26.2f). Finally, in frame- work silicates, all four corners of the tetrahe- dron are shared, resulting in a three-dimensional framework, SiO 2, such as that for tridymite (Figure 26.2g).

In these cases the ratios are best determined by counting Si and O within a repeat period. If we know the chemical formula and thus the Si:O or T:O ratio for a silicate min- eral, we can assign it to a group. (There are a few exceptions to this simple rule. In orthosilicates in particular there are structures that have both isolated tetrahedra and groups. Also, there are ex- amples, where not all oxygen atoms are linked to silicon tetrahedra. Nevertheless, it is a good rule of thumb.) Table 26.2 summarizes the tetrahedral classi\ufb01cation of silicates and gives an example for each group. Except for pure SiO 2, which has a framework structure, the tetrahedra are not charge balanced and in silicates insertion of additional cations produces electrostatic neutrality. We will follow mainly this tetrahedral classi\ufb01cation, \ufb01rst sug- gested by W.L. Bragg (1930), but we will keep in mind that, like all classi\ufb01cations, it is arti\ufb01cial and designed only to organize our thoughts. It is increasingly recognized that numerous inter- mediate structures exist between these groups. In many cases it is more useful to emphasize similarities and relationships between various structures in minerals of the different groups, rather than differences. Orthosilicates In this section we review those silicate miner- als that have isolated tetrahedra and groups of tetrahedra. Minerals in this group are generally characterized by a low Si:O ratio, by fairly close packing and a corresponding high density. Ta- ble 26.3 lists common mineral representatives and some of their diagnostic properties. Olivine ((Mg, Fe) 2SiO4) is typical of silicates with isolated tetrahedra. It forms a continu- ous solid solution between pure magnesium olivine forsterite (Mg 2SiO4) and pure iron olivine fayalite (Fe2SiO4) (see the discussion concerning Figure 18.1). The structure of olivine has or- thorhombic symmetry, with the oxygen atoms forming nearly hexagonal close packing and Figure 26.3a shows two close-packed layers of oxygen atoms (large circles), parallel to (100).

As this \ufb01gure il- lustrates, there are two octahedra of slightly dif- ferent shapes, one of them called M1 and the other one M2 . In particular, the M1 octahedra deviate considerably from an ideal octahedral ge- ometry. Under most conditions iron and mag- nesium are distributed fairly randomly over the two structural sites, i.e., the Mg/Fe distribution is disordered. In the tetragonal mineral zircon (ZrSiO 4), 8 oxygen ions in an irregular dodecahedral coordi- nation surround the large zirconium ion, while silicon is surrounded by four oxygen ions in a tetrahedron. The tetrahedra and dodecahedra share edges and extend as chains parallel to the c-axis (Figure 26.5a). Because of its size, the do- decahedron can accomodate larger ions such as uranium, thorium, and yttrium and those fre- quently substitute for some of the zirconium in the zircon structure. Zircons are well suited for isotopic age determinations that depend on the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. The structure of the cubic mineral garnet has similar chains of edge-sharing tetrahedra and dodecahedra (Figure 26.5b), but they are linked in a manner slightly different from", "page": 449}

In the case of garnet (b) two chains are linked by additional octahedra. that of zircon and the structural motif repeats after two dodecahedral--tetrahedral units (\u223c12 \u02daA). Garnets contain additional cations: octahedrally coordinated aluminum link the dodecahedral-- tetrahedral chains. Each oxygen has one tetra- hedral (IV), one octahedral (VI), and two do- decahedral (VIII) cations as next neighbors, and the general formula of garnet can be expressed as X VIII 3 M VI 2 SiIV 3 O12. This structure lends itself to many isomorphous substitutions. Table 26.4 shows some important substitutions in natural garnets, some corresponding physical properties (refractive index, density), and the a lattice pa- rameter. These properties are used for purposes of identi\ufb01cation, and determinative charts have been designed (see Figure 14.1b). The structure of tetragonal vesuvianite (Ca 10 Mg2Al4(SiO4)5(Si2O7)2(OH)4), is closely related to the garnet structure. The c lattice parameter is almost identical to the a lattice parameter of grossular (11.85 \u02daA), but contrary to garnet, vesu- vianite contains both SiO 4\u2212 4 and Si2O6\u2212 7 groups. The epidote minerals, with the general for- mula X VIII 2 M VI 3 SiO4Si2O7(O, OH, F) 2, combine iso- lated SiO4\u2212 4 tetrahedra and Si 2O6\u2212 7 groups. Table 26.5 lists some end member compositions in this series of minerals in which ionic substitutions on the octahedral site M are ubiquitous. Polymorphs of Al 2SiO5, kyanite, sillimanite, and andalusite, have gained petrological signi\ufb01cance because their occurrence in metamorphic pelitic schists can be related to temperature--pressure conditions during crystallization, as will be dis- cussed later. In these minerals, the structures do not \ufb01t the simple classi\ufb01cation described above and the Si:O ratio rule does not apply because one oxygen atom is not part of any tetrahe- dra. Thus the formula is sometimes written as Al 2SiO4O. In the triclinic high-pressure polymorph kyan- ite, oxygen atoms form cubic close-packing, all aluminum is in octahedral interstices, and sil- icon is in tetrahedral interstices.

In orthorhombic sillimanite, half of the alu- minum is in octahedral sites and octahedra form chains parallel to the c-axis, as in kyanite. The other half of the aluminum is in tetrahedral sites. Aluminum and silicon tetrahedra alternate to form corner-sharing double chains that link the octahedral chains (Figure 26.6b). In this re- spect (tetrahedral chains), sillimanite has simi- larities with chain silicates with perfect cleavage and frequent \ufb01brous growth. In orthorhombic andalusite, aluminum not be- longing to the octahedral chains occupies sites in a 5-fold coordinated polyhedron in an irregular shape of a trigonal bipyramid (Figure 26.6c).

In these rocks, forsterite forms un- der regional metamorphism of quartz-bearing dolomites owing to a reaction of the type 2CaMg(CO3)2 + SiO2 \u21cc Mg2SiO4 + 2CaCO3 + 2CO2 Dolomite Quartz Forsterite Calcite Forsterite in these rocks is commonly accompa- nied by calcite, phlogopite, magnetite, black or pink spinel, and chondrodite. Compositionally intermediate members of olivines are common in many igneous rocks. They occur in basalts, and other extrusive rocks as isolated inclusions, translucent poorly devel- oped crystals, and granular masses of green to brown color, with vitreous luster. They are also a major constituent of dunites and peri- dotites. A magnesium-rich olivine, though not pure forsterite, is the dominant mineral of the earth\u2019s upper mantle and for this reason has re- ceived much attention from geophysicists. Fay- alite is the only olivine that may occur together with quartz. This is a rare mineral, and it is found in some skarns, granite pegmatites, meta- morphic rocks and a few rhyolites. Hydrothermal processes lead to the hydrolysis of forsterite and magnesium-rich olivines, replac- ing them by serpentine and talc. Schematically, these reactions may be represented in the follow- ing form: 4Mg2SiO4 + H2O + 5CO2 \u2192 Mg3Si4O10(OH)2 + 5MgCO3 Forsterite Talc Magnesite 2Mg2SiO4 + 2H2O + CO2 \u2192 Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 + MgCO3 Forsterite Serpentine Magnesite Similar processes can take place when silicon in- teracts with the olivine-rich rocks in hydrother- mal solutions. For example: 3Mg2SiO4 + 5SiO2 + 2H2O \u21cc 2Mg3Si4O10(OH)2 Forsterite In solution Talc 3Mg2SiO4 + SiO2 + 2H2O \u21cc 2Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 Forsterite In solution Serpentine Transparent green olivines (peridot) are extracted from kimberlites and used as a gemstone. One needs some experience to identify olivine with con\ufb01dence. In basalts, olivine minerals look like fragments of green bottle-glass; in ultrama\ufb01c rocks olivine is often partially replaced by talc and serpentine, both of which are easy to iden- tify. Contrary to pyroxenes, olivine has con- choidal fracture, rather than a regular cleavage. In thin sections olivine is recognized by high bire- fringence (see Chapter 10 and Plate 3f ). Chondrodite, humite,a n dclinohumite are structurally related to olivine in the sense that layers of olivine (parallel to (100)) are interca- lated between layers of brucite (Mg(F, OH) 2)( p a r - allel to (0001)). As a result, the bulk formulas of these minerals can be written in the follow- ing way: for chondrodite 2Mg 2SiO4\u00b7Mg(F, OH) 2, for humite 3Mg 2SiO4\u00b7Mg(F, OH) 2, and for clino- humite 4Mg 2SiO4\u00b7Mg(F, OH) 2. Humite minerals occur in bright-orange and brownish-orange an- hedral grains in marbles and are accompanied by forsterite, spinel, and dolomite. In thin sec- tion they have a yellow pleochroism. The color is diagnostic. It is dif\ufb01cult to distinguish between the humite varieties without a detailed analysis. Zircon (ZrSiO 4), may contain high contents of uranium, thorium, cerium, hafnium, niobium, tantalum, and aluminum. It commonly forms perfect crystals with tetragonal symmetry (Plate 16a). The phenomenon of typomorphism can be well illustrated", "page": 452}
{"text": "with zircon: silica-poor rocks usu- ally contain \ufb02at, platy crystals, whereas elon- gated crystals are more common in siliceous rocks. Zircon has a brownish color in various shades and a diamantine luster. Its hardness ranges from 7 to 8. Zircon is found in all igneous rocks, but it is especially abundant in nepheline syenites and related pegmatites. Radioactive varieties of zir- con occur in granite pegmatites. Zircon is very stable and does not easily weather chemically or abrade physically. Therefore it accumulates in sands, which form commercial deposits of zircon placers in sandstones and conglomerates (zircon sands). Zircon is used as a casting material in metallurgy, and as a source of zirconium oxide (\u2018\u2018zirconia\u2019\u2019) and hafnium (Hf substituting for Zr). Transparent reddish varieties (\u2018\u2018hyacynths\u2019\u2019) are gemstones.

Zircons are easily identi\ufb01ed on the basis of their euhedral morphology, their diamantine lus- ter, and their high hardness. In thin section zir- con has a high refractive index (2.0) and high bire- fringence (0.05). When included in biotite, zircon produces pleochroic halos (Plate 4e,f), owing to structural damage from radiation. Garnets belong to a large group of miner- als that have the general formula R 2+ 3 R3+ 2 (SiO4)3 (Table 26.4). All garnets form euhedral crystals in the form of rhombic dodecahedra and trapezo- hedra, or combinations of the two (Figure 26.7, Plate 14f). They have a vitreous luster and high hardness from 6.5 to 7.5. The most abundant gar- nets, their colors, and deposit types are listed in Table 26.6. On the whole, garnets are easy to identify because of their distinct crystal mor- phology and colors. At \ufb01rst it may be dif\ufb01cult to recognize green and brown garnets in mas- sive aggregates of greasy luster, found in skarns and hornfelses. Observation of high hardness, lack of cleavage faces, and the presence of small well-developed crystals along calcite veinlets can be helpful. In thin sections, garnets are imme- diately recognized because the cubic mineral is isotropic, except for grossular, which may show slight birefringence. Almandine is used as an abrasive material. Clear pyrope and uvarovite are gemstones. Vesuvianite (Ca 10Al4Mg2(SiO4)5(Si2O7)2(OH)4), formerly also called idocrase, is a typical min- eral in skarns and calcsilicate rocks. In skarns, vesuvianite forms easily recognizable tetragonal-- prismatic crystals and columnar aggregates of brown, grayish-brown, or red-brown color. If no crystals are observed, vesuvianite may be dif- \ufb01cult to distinguish from andradite or grossu- lar garnets because they have the same hard- ness and similar appearance (irregular masses of brown, greenish-yellow, and yellow color). It is easy to distinguish vesuvianite in thin sec- tion: cubic garnets are usually optically isotropic, whereas tetragonal vesuvianite shows anomalous birefringence (0.04). Aluminosilicates (Al 2SiO5) include the three polymorphs, kyanite, andalusite,a n dsilliman- ite. Kyanite occurs as colorless, cyan-blue (hence the name) elongate--tabular crystals with a pearly luster (Plate 16c). Kyanite crystals exhibit a pro- nounced anisotropy of hardness (about 7 perpen- dicular to the longest axis, and 3.5--4 parallel to it); for this reason, the mineral is sometimes called disthen, which means \u2018\u2018double hardness\u2019\u2019 in Greek. Andalusite is found as prismatic pink, green, or gray crystals,", "page": 453}

Sillimanite, in accordance with its chain-like crystal struc- ture, occurs as colorless needles and \ufb01brous masses (called fibrolite). The minerals form in alu- minous metamorphic rocks. In thin section aluminosilicates are color- less and have fairly high refractive indices (1.65-- 1.73) with a birefringence higher than quartz and feldspars (0.015). Triclinic kyanite is distin- guished from orthorhombic sillimanite by in- clined extinction of the cleavage (Plates 4c,d). Al 2SiO5 minerals are used for manufacturing refractory materials in metallurgy and the ce- ramics industry. The high temperature mineral mullite with a nonstoichiometric composition AlAl 1\u22122x Si1\u22122x O5\u2212x is structurally closely related to sillimanite. Mullite is rare in nature but an important ceramic product. Staurolite ((Fe 2+, Mg) 2 (Al, Fe 3+)9 O6 (SiO4)4 OOH), similar to the aluminosilicates, occurs in micaceous schists. Staurolite is found as brown to black prismatic, well-developed crystals (often poikiloblastic) and as cross-like twins of such crys- tals (Figure 26.8a).

Chloritoid occurs in some low-grade meta- morphic rocks and has often been overlooked because of its resemblance to chlorite. In thin sections it is distinguished from chlorite by a higher refractive index and inclined extinction. Titanite (CaTiSiO 4O), also called sphene, has monoclinic, wedge-shaped (diamond-like), brown/green-colored crystals that are frequently twinned (Figure 26.8b). Titanite has a strong vitre- ous to diamantine luster and imperfect cleavage (a) (b) Fig. 26.8 (a) T winned staurolite from Keivy, Kola Peninsula, Russia (width 120 mm) (courtesy A. Massanek). (b) T winned titanite crystals from Druntobel, Swiss Alps (width 50 mm) (from Stalder et al., 1973). that are used in the identi\ufb01cation. Small yellow and honey-yellow radiaxial aggregates of titanite occur in granodiorites. Titanite has very high birefringence (2.0) and refractive index (0.13) and cannot be mistaken in thin section. It is widespread in nature and occurs in var- ious rocks as an accessory phase. Considerable concentrations of titanite (up to 50 vol.%) are found in nepheline syenites and associated peg- matites. Topaz (Al 2SiO4F2) is orthorhombic with pris- matic, lengthwise-striated crystals, elongated along the c-axis, and a perfect pinacoidal cleav- age on (001). More rarely it occurs as columnar aggregates and irregularly shaped grains. Its lus- ter is vitreous. Topaz crystals are transparent, col- orless, blue, or golden-yellow (Plate 15a), often with sector-zoning and banded patterns of color distribution within a crystal. Sector zoning is due to the fact that different faces adsorb different amounts of trace elements (see Chapter 5). The", "page": 454}

METAMORPHISM prism faces and corresponding growth sectors are u s u a l l yp a l eb l u e( o w i n gt ot r a c e so fF e2+), growth sectors of inclining faces such as those of a rhom- bic bipyramid are golden-yellow (Fe 3+). The hard- ness of topaz is 8. The distinguishing features of topaz are its hardness, crystal morphology, stria- tion, and cleavage perpendicular to its striation. Topaz differs from quartz in crystal morphology, in having a higher density (3.6 as compared to 2.6 g/cm 3), in its cleavage, and in its stronger luster. Unlike topaz, quartz crystals are striated perpen- dicular to their long axis. Topaz occurs in granite pegmatites, where large crystals, weighing sometimes well over 10 kg, are concentrated in pockets. In greisens, topaz is often a major component and found either as granular masses or in veinlets and pockets as well-developed euhedral crystals and columnar aggregates. There are also hydrother- mal topaz--quartz pockets in limestones. The for- mation of topaz in quartz--micaceous greisens results from the interaction between feldspars and high-temperature \ufb02uorine-rich hydrother- mal supercritical solutions. This interaction may be schematically represented by the following reaction: 2KAlSi3O8 + 2F\u2212 + 2H+ \u21cc K-feldspar Al2SiO4F2 + 5SiO2 + 2K+ + 2OH\u2212 Topaz Quartz Topaz of good quality and intense color is a val- ued gemstone. Lawsonite (CaAl 2(OH)2Si2O7\u00b7H2O) is a rel- atively rare mineral in high-pressure--low- temperature metamorphic rocks (for further discussion of this type of metamorphism, see \u2018\u2018Metamorphic minerals\u201d, below). It occurs as veins of white, light green, or gray prismatic crystals. Lawsonite has good cleavage. It forms because of the breakdown of calcic plagioclase at high pressure, for example in subduction zones: CaAl2Si2O8 + 2H2O \u21cc CaAl2(OH)2Si2O7 \u00b7H2O Anorthite Lawsonite It is one of the high pressure minerals that con- tain water and may be a signi\ufb01cant hydrous phase in the upper mantle. The epidote group includes the isostructural minerals clinozoisite, epidote,a n dallanite with the general formula X 2+ 2 Y3+ 3 (SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH) (see Table 26.5). Clinozoisite is generally grayish- white, epidote forms prismatic striated crystals, elongated parallel to the b-axis, with a vitre- ous luster and a very characteristic pistachio- or spinach-green color (Plate 16b), allanite (also called orthite) occurs as elongated prismatic crys- tals of brown or black color. All epidote minerals have a poor cleavage. In thin section, epidote and allanite are easily recognized by brilliant anoma- lous interference colors (Plate 5a). Clinozoisite is typical of low-grade metamor- phic rocks. Epidote is very common in schists and skarns. Allanite is found in granites, in granite pegmatites, and in metamorphic rocks as an ac- cessory. It is often metamict owing to radiation damage from decay of substituting traces of ra- dioactive elements. Ring silicates In some silicates, tetrahedra are linked to form closed rings of three (benitoite, Figure 26.9a), four (axinite), or six tetrahedra (tourmaline, beryl (Figure 26.9b), cordierite, dioptase).

In a ring, two oxygen atoms of each tetra- hedron are shared, resulting in an Si:O ratio of 1:3.

In the trigonal structure of tour- maline, major units are six-membered rings of silicon--oxygen tetrahedra and anionic groups BO 3\u2212 3 . Tourmaline crystals are often euhedral, ditrigonal-prismatic, and columnar in habit, with a rough lengthwise striation (see Figure 5.27a). Tourmalines cut perpendicular to the long axis [0001] have the shape of rounded trian- gles. The crystals of this noncentrosymmetrical mineral, in which the positive c-axis is distinct from the negative c-axis, are often terminated by pyramidal faces at one end and by basal faces at the opposite end. Radial aggregates are typical of some tourmalines (so-called \u2018\u2018tourmaline suns\u2019\u2019). Colors may be black (that of iron-rich schorl varieties), pink (owing to manganese in elbaites and rubellites), blue, green, brown, and white for compositionally different tourmalines. Multicolored crystals and crystals in which zones of different color alternate from the core outward are very typical (Plates 5c and 15b). Luster is vitreous on the faces and greasy on fractures. Tourmalines have a hardness of 7 and no cleavage. The crystals are very brittle and fre- quently have perpendicular fractures \ufb01lled with quartz. In thin section, tourmaline is strongly pleochroic; however, contrary to the pleochroism in most other prismatic minerals, the darkest color (highest absorption) is observed when plane polarized light is vibrating perpendicular to the elongation direction. Tourmalines are found in granites, peg- matites, high-temperature hydrothermal quartz veins, schists, and gneisses. In all these rocks, black ferriferous tourmalines are common, but in spodumene-bearing granite pegmatites, rubel- lites are found. Beryl (Be 3Al2Si6O18) has a structure with six- membered tetrahedral rings that de\ufb01ne large channels running parallel to the 6-fold axis of this hexagonal mineral. These channels can ac- commodate additional cations of alkali metals (Na +) and water molecules. Some beryls con- tain small quantities of manganese, trivalent iron, and chromium that isomorphically sub- stitute for aluminum. These trace substitutions are responsible for the varieties of color. There are blue aquamarines (iron at the beryllium sites) (Plate 15c); common green beryls (iron at the aluminum sites); colorless and milky-white, iron-free, alkali beryls; bright green emeralds (chromium substituting for aluminum) (Plate 15d); pink morganites (manganese substituting for aluminum); and yellow heliodores ( i r o ni nt h es i l - icon sites). Luster is always vitreous on the faces and greasy on the fracture surfaces.", "page": 456}
{"text": "440 ORTHOSILICATES AND RING SILICATES. METAMORPHISM Beryl crystals are hexagonal--prismatic in habit. The crystals are commonly striated length- wise. Hardness is 7--8. Beryl can be recognized eas- ily by its crystal morphology and by the typical green or blue color. White-colored alkali beryls, however, are often mistaken for quartz. The beryls are a good illustration of how chemical composition and thus color depends on conditions of formation. Ferriferous beryls (green, pale blue) form in granite pegmatites, and high-temperature hydrothermal deposits. Color- less and milky-white alkali beryls are common accessories in granite pegmatites of the sodium-- lithium type. Chromian beryls (emeralds) occur in \ufb02uorite-bearing micaceous metasomatic rocks, replacing ultrama\ufb01cs, and in quartz-albite veins with rare earth carbonates in bituminous lime- stones. Beryl and its varieties are used for the extraction of beryllium and as gemstones. Cordierite ((Mg, Fe 2+)2Al3Si5AlO18), though or- thorhombic, has a structure that is closely re- lated to that of hexagonal beryl. One aluminum ion substitutes for silicon in tetrahedral coordi- nation. Generally, cordierite is ink-blue in color and translucent. Its hardness is 7--7.5. Translucent grains that change their color when rotated are used as gemstones (dichroism). Unless cordierite occurs as large crystals, it is dif\ufb01cult to iden- tify, even in thin sections, and is easily over- looked as plagioclase. It displays characteristic pleochroic halos around monazite (not zircon) in- clusions (Plate 4e,f ) and often forms intergrowths of multiple twins with a pseudohexagonal sym- metry. Rounded small (2--3 mm) grains are not uncommon in aluminous metamorphic schists, gneisses, and hornfelses. Dioptase (Cu 6Si6O18\u00b76H2O) is a rare rhombo- hedral ring silicate occurring as well-developed rhombohedral crystals of intense green color in calcite and dolomite veins in localities of Za \u00a8\u0131re, Tsumeb (Namibia), and Pinal County in Arizona (USA). Dioptase is occasionally used as a gem- stone. Metamorphic minerals Many orthosilicates -- garnets, epidotes, and alu- minosilicates among them -- occur mainly in metamorphic rocks. They are the products of recrystallization in solid state from pre-existing mineral assemblages that are no longer stable ow- ing to changes in temperature or pressure. Under such conditions, chemical reactions take place to form new minerals. Changes in temperature and pressure can occur in different geological settings. If rocks are buried by accumulating sed- iments, and pressure and temperature increase progressively, the metamorphism is called burial metamorphism and is usually very extensive, cov- ering large regions (regional metamorphism). Tem- peratures may also increase rapidly in the vicin- ity of an intruding pluton. In this case, heat has been transported to a shallow level by the magma, and pressures are relatively low as com- pared with those of a normal geothermal gra- dient. Such high-temperature--low-pressure meta- morphism is limited to the direct vicinity of the igneous contact and is called contact metamor- phism. In another setting, parts of the crust are subducted at continental margins; here, the pres- sure increases more rapidly than the temperature because,whereas pressure response is immediate, thermal conductivity of rocks is very slow. If such rocks are brought up to", "page": 457}

During metamorphism, limestones transform into marbles, with minerals such as forsterite, humite, vesuvianite and grossular; sandstones transform into quartzites; mudstones transform into slates and at higher temperature into pelitic schists, with such minerals as biotite, gar- net, andalusite, kyanite, sillimanite, chloritoid, staurolite, and cordierite. Recrystallization dur- ing a temperature increase is almost necessar- ily accompanied by dehydration and decarbona- tion. With increasing temperature, muscovite, a hydrous sheet silicate in pelitic schists, trans- forms into anhydrous sillimanite and K-feldspar: KAl2AlSi3O10(OH)2 + SiO2 \u2192 Muscovite Quartz Al2SiO5 + KAlSi3O8 + H2O Sillimanite K-feldspar Water", "page": 457}

In quartz-bearing limestones, decarbonation occurs, as in the following reaction that produces wollastonite, a chain silicate: CaCO3 + SiO2 \u2192 CaSiO3 + CO2 Calcite Quartz Wollastonite Reactions that occur with increasing tempera- ture are called prograde reactions. You may wonder why metamorphic rocks do not revert to their original low-grade assemblages, when they are uplifted and cooled? Why do we still observe sil- limanite in metamorphic rocks, while muscovite and clay minerals would be stable at surface con- ditions? The prograde dehydration and decarbon- ation reactions such as those above are the main reason. During those transformations, volatile phases (i.e., H 2Oa n dC O2) are expelled and the reaction cannot be reversed. If water enters a metamorphic system during cooling, however, so- called retrograde reactions may occur and replace some of the high-grade metamorphic minerals.

Let us refer again to the phase diagram for these min- erals (see Figure 17.2b) and recall that andalusite is stable at low pressure and intermediate temperature, kyanite at high pressure, and sil- limanite at high temperature. The distribution of andalusite, kyanite, and sillimanite can be mapped in the \ufb01eld, such as in the central Alps, where a granitic pluton has been emplaced in a stack of gneisses in the Miocene (Figure 26.10a). The distribution of the polymorphs is very regu- lar and outlines regions of kyanite in the north- west, andalusite to the east (along the granite contact shown as a dotted line), and silliman- ite in the central part. At the border between two regions, two aluminosilicate minerals coex- ist, and where all three regions meet, near A in the north and B in the south, the location corre- sponds to the triple point. At this point all three polymorphs were in equilibrium at the time of metamorphism and in fact are observed in the same thin section (Plate 4d). The same rocks that contain pure alumi- nosilicates also bear iron and magnesium alumi- nous silicates such as chloritoid, staurolite, and cordierite. The regional distribution of those min- erals is equally regular (Figure 26.10b). The distri- bution of chloritoid is far to the north. Stauro- lite closely overlaps with kyanite, and cordierite with sillimanite.

At this point temperature-- pressure conditions are strictly de\ufb01ned. Metamorphic rocks are generally classi\ufb01ed ac- cording to the mineralogical composition of their major constituents. For example, gneisses con- tain quartz, feldspar and mica; marbles contain carbonates (calcite or dolomite); and amphibo- lites contain hornblende. The mineralogical com- position is in turn controlled by temperature and pressure conditions and by the chemical compo- sition. An important consideration is the thermo- dynamic phase rule (Chapter 17), which is applied in Box 26.1 to metamorphic rocks.", "page": 460}
{"text": "444 ORTHOSILICATES AND RING SILICATES. METAMORPHISM Box 26.1 Applying the phase rule to metamorphic rocks In Chapter 17 we introduced the phase rule of Willard Gibbs, which states that, for a system in equilibrium, the following relation holds between the number of coexisting phases p, the number of components c, and the degrees of freedom f : p = c + 2 \u2212 f (26.1) During the process of mineral formation in metamorphic rocks, pressure P and temperature T are not constant but range over a largeP\u2013T interval, corresponding to a region in the P\u2013T phase diagram. Thus both P and T are variable, providing two degrees of freedom. Under these conditions the phase rule reduces to p \u2264 c (26.2) which is known as the mineralogical phase rule and was introduced by V.M. Gold- schmidt (1911). According to this rule, the number of different minerals in a rock should not exceed the number of components. (Because of solid solutions the number of minerals may be fewer.) Let us take a ternary system with the components Al 2SiO5\u2013CaSiO3\u2013(Mg, Fe)SiO3 (Figure 26.12). Such a system is representative of shales. In this trian- gle there are seven minerals at low-pressure\u2013high-temperature conditions (corre- sponding to point E in Figure 26.11). Most of these minerals have been introduced in this chapter. Any combination of three minerals may coexist according to the phase rule. The particular combination depends on the overall chemical com- position of the rock and the P\u2013T conditions. (Only two minerals may coexist in two-component systems on the sides of the triangle.) We describe some of the combinations below, with each numbered combination referring to one of the labeled compositions in Figure 26.12: 1. In a calcium-free, aluminum- and (magnesium,\u2013iron)-bearing rock of compo- sition 1 (corresponding to a pure shale), andalusite (or kyanite, or sillimanite, depending on P\u2013T ) and cordierite coexist. 2. If we add some calcium (composition 2), anorthite forms in addition to an- dalusite and cordierite. (If some sodium is present, a more sodium-rich plagio- clase will form instead of anorthite.) 3. Decreasing the amount of aluminum shifts the composition to 3, and anorthite, cordierite, and hypersthene coexist. 4. Decreasing aluminum further, to composition 4, brings us into a \ufb01eld where anorthite, hypersthene, and diopside coexist. Conceivably anorthite, cordierite, and diopside could coexist, but this mineral assemblage is not observed under conditions of high-temperature metamorphism. 5. If we now once again increase calcium (e.g., in impure limestones) to arrive at composition 5, we are in a \ufb01eld with anorthite, diopside, and grossularite. 6. Increasing calcium even further (in more pure limestones) brings us into a \ufb01eld of coexisting grossularite, diopside, and wollastonite (composition 6). We mark coexisting phases with tielines. According to the phase rule, tielines always outline a triangle and can never cross.

(see Box 26.1.) On the basis of characteristic mineral as- semblages, the temperature--pressure \ufb01eld has been divided into metamorphic facies as illustrated in Figure 26.13a, which also shows the normal geothermal gradient of 25 \u25e6C/km in the conti- nental lithosphere. Some facies occur at higher pressure than a normal geothermal gradient (blueschist, eclogite facies), many follow a normal geothermal gradient (zeolite, greenschist, amphi- bolite, and granulite facies), and some occur at higher temperature (hornfels and sanidinite fa- cies). Chlorite, epidote, and albite are typical min- erals of the greenschist facies, which derives its name from the green minerals chlorite and epi- dote. The amphibolite facies is characterized by the presence of hornblende, plagioclase, and gar- net (almandine), and by the absence of chlorite. Hypersthene, sillimanite, and cordierite occur in granulite facies, but compared with the amphi- bolite facies, hornblende is no longer present. Minerals typical of high-pressure metamor- phism are lawsonite, jadeite, glaucophane, arag- onite, and, in very extreme cases, coesite and diamond. The temperature--pressure calibration of metamorphic facies relies on critical mineral reactions where equilibrium phase diagrams have been established either experimentally or by thermodynamic calculations.

{"text": "Chapter 27 Sheet silicates. Weathering of silicate rocks Structural features The next group of silicate minerals that we dis- cuss are sheet silicates, also called phyllosilicates (after the Greek \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb /H9265\u03bd (phyllon, meaning leaf)). Most of the minerals in this group have a \ufb02aky habit and an excellent single cleavage. The habit and cleavage are due to planar units in the crystal structure. All sheet silicates contain, in addition to O 2\u2212,O H\u2212 groups as anions. We mentioned in Chapter 26 that silicon tetrahedra (SiO4\u2212 4 ) in sheet silicates are polymer- ized to form an in\ufb01nite two-dimensional net with six-membered rings and hexagonal symme- try (Figure 27.1). Contrary to the tetrahedral nets of tridymite and cristobalite, where alternat- ing apices point in opposite directions (and are linked to another net) (Figure 19.3a), in sheet silicates all free tetrahedral apices point in the same direction. Within a sheet silicate net, three corners of each tetrahedron are shared with another, resulting in a structural base of the tetrahedral network Si 2O2\u2212 5 . Such a layer has a negative charge that is neutralized by interstitial layers of cations and anions. The distance between free oxygen apices in a net is close to 1.3 \u02daA, and this value is very similar to the O \u2212O distance of a coordination octahe- dron (1.4 \u02daA). Therefore the tetrahedral layer \ufb01ts almost perfectly on top of a layer of octahedra that lie on triangular sides and share edges (Fig- ure 27.2a). As the tetrahedral layer is attached to the octahedral layer, corresponding oxygen atoms are shared. Those anions in octahedral layers that are shared with tetrahedra are O 2\u2212; those that are not shared are hydroxyl groups (OH \u2212). We have seen structures with in\ufb01nite octahedral layers in the discussion of hydroxides (see Chapter 25). The structure of brucite (see Figure 25.9a) consists of sheets of edge-sharing Mg(OH) 4\u2212 6 octahedra (trioctahedral), and the structure of gibbsite (see Figure 25.9b) consists of sheets of Al(OH) 3\u2212 6 octahedra with one third of the octahedral sites vacant (dioctahedra). We can view the basic building unit of a sheet silicate as an octahedral layer (brucite or gibbsite type, depending on the charge of the cation) with an attached tetrahedral layer, and these units are periodically stacked. The main cations in sheet silicates are Mg 2+,A l 3+,F e 2+,a n dF e 3+. In the case of divalent ions, all octahedral interstices are occupied and the cation coverage is continuous (Figure 27.2a). For trivalent ions one out of three octahedral interstices is kept vacant to maintain charge balance (Figure 27.2b), as in hydroxides. The trioctahedral unit is more symmetrical than the dioctahedral unit. Indeed the structure in Figure 27.2b is highly idealized. In a realistic structure of a dioctahedral sheet silicate, for example muscovite (Figure 27.3), the octahedra are distorted, the tetrahedra are rotated (as indicated by arrows), and the tetrahe- dral and octahedral rings are no longer ideally hexagonal. There are two types of building unit:", "page": 465}

The corresponding dioctahedral kaolinite has the formula Al 2Si2O5(OH)4. For 2:1 structures there is more Si 4+ and less OH \u2212. The formula for trioctahedral talc is Mg 3Si4O10(OH)2 and for corresponding dioctahedral pyrophyllite Al2Si4O10(OH)2. You can verify these formulas by counting atoms in a repeat unit, see for example Figure 27.2. The octahedral--tetrahedral sheet of talc is well balanced, with tetrahedral layers attached to both sides of the octahedral layer. In serpen- tine, with a tetrahedral net only on one side, and interatomic distances slightly shorter in tetra- hedra than in octahedra, there are forces that bend the sheet. In the serpentine variety known as chrysotile asbestos , bending is continuous and the sheet becomes scroll-like (Figure 27.5a), giving rise to asbestos \ufb01bers with a textile-resembling fabric (Figure 27.6). The scroll-like pattern can be seen in high-resolution electron micrographs (Figure 27.7). In the serpentine variety antigorite, bending occurs only over a few unit cells, after which the polarity of the Si 4O12\u2212 10 nets is reversed, producing a wavy structure (Figure 27.5b). This means that two-dimensional in\ufb01nite nets break up into bands with free corners of tetrahedra pointing in alternate directions. In kaolinite this unbalanced structure is the cause for a very small crystal size. In Figure 27.8 we illustrate the stacking of the octahedral--tetrahedral units in a more schematic way perpendicular to the plane of the lay- ers. The structure of the hydroxides brucite-- gibbsite (Figure 27.8a) is given for reference, fol- lowed by serpentine--kaolinite (Figure 27.8b) and talc--pyrophyllite (Figure 27.8c). In micas part of the tetrahedral Si 4+ is re- p l a c e db yA l3+. To maintain charge balance, large cations (Na +,K +,C a 2+) are introduced be- tween the sheets (Figure 27.8d). The large cations are in 12-fold oxygen coordination between six- membered rings of adjacent tetrahedral nets (see Figure 27.2). Since sheets are no longer electro- statically neutral, the bonding between sheets is partially ionic. Therefore, the hardness of mi- cas is higher than that of talc, and the cleav- age is less perfect. Micas can be subdivided according to chemical composition. Analogous to talc--pyrophyllite, there are trioctahedral and dioctahedral micas, depending on the charge of octahedral cations, mainly Mg 2+ and Al3+.

In chlorites, additional brucite layers, con- sisting of hydroxyl-coordinated octahedra (Fig- ure 27.8e) replace the layers of large cations present in micas. There is a wide variety of chlo- rites having different chemical compositions, with Mg 2+,F e 2+,F e 3+,a n dA l 3+ competing for octahedral positions. Table 27.2 gives some exam- ples and the corresponding distribution of ions over the various structural sites. As Figure 27.8 documents, a signi\ufb01cant differ- ence between the various sheet silicate structures is observed in the spacing of sheets. With increas- ing complexity, going from brucite to chlorite, the repeat distance increases from approximately 5t o1 4 \u02daA. The sheet plane is parallel to (001) and a diagnostic property is the interplanar spacing d 001, which can be measured easily with X-ray powder diffraction. The magnesium minerals paligorskite and se- piolite can be viewed as degenerate talc struc- tures with tetrahedral sheets switching direc- tions to form three-dimensional connections (Figure 27.9). Octahedral layers (shaded) are no longer continuous, but stacked, producing large channels that contain molecular water. These structures are reminiscent of manganese oxides (see Figure 25.8). Properties of important sheet silicates are listed in Table 27.3. S of a rw eh a v ed i s c u s s e ds t a c k i n go fl a y - ers with different compositions and various substitutions of cations. Another way to add diversity is to keep the composition constant but vary the geometrical relationship between adjacent layers. Such derivative structures that are variations of long-range stacking of layers are called polytypes. There is a great variety of polytypes in sheet silicates, and we will use them to discuss the general principle of polytypism (Box 27.1). Clay minerals are essentially hydrous alu- minous sheet silicates with variable composi- tion and water content. They are important components of mudstones and claystones -- sed- imentary rocks that may also contain other minerals such as quartz and calcite. Clays are components of soils.

{"text": "456 SHEET SILICATES. WEATHERING OF SILICATE ROCKS Box 27.1 Polytypism in sheet silicates In polymorphs and polytypes the chemical composition is the same but the struc- ture differs. In polymorphs (see Chapter 6), short-range atomic arrangements differ, but in polytypes only the long-range stacking of structural units varies. Polymorphs have different mineral names whereas polytypes are structural varieties of the same mineral. In sheet silicates, polytypism is due to stacking of tetrahedral\u2013octahedral sheets. We con\ufb01ne our discussion to the basic principles of polytypism in ideal mica, where tetrahedral and octahedral layers have trigonal/hexagonal symmetry. There are two factors that contribute to polytypism: the orientation of the octahedra in the layer relative to a tetrahedral layer, and the disposition of the tetrahedral nets between subsequent layers. Octahedra in a layer may be pointing in one direction relative to the top tetrahedral layer (Figure 27.10a, referred to as \u201c+\u201d) or in the opposite direction (Figure 27.10b, referred to as \u201c\u2212\u201d). If two tetrahedral\u2013octahedral units are stacked on top of each other, this allows for two possibilities. In Figure 27.11a octahedra in all layers point in the same direction (+,+), and in Figure 27.11b octahedra in adjacent layers point in opposite directions (+, \u2212). Figure 27.11a shows schematically that if octahedra in all layers point in the same direction, then the basic monoclinic symmetry is maintained and the structure pattern repeats after one layer. This polytype is called 1 M (i.e., one-layer repeat, Monoclinic). If adjacent layers point in opposite directions, a mirror (m) plane parallel to the sheet plane is introduced, producing an orthorhombic structure called 2 O (Figure 27.11b), and the repeat distance, and thus the unit cell, is doubled. A second, more subtle, reason for polytypism in sheet silicates is the attachment of the tetrahedral layer to the octahedral layer. Figure 27.12a shows an octahedral layer with shaded triangles on the top surface. A tetrahedral net is attached to the top surface (solid lines connect those apices that are shared with octahedra). The net attached to the bottom surface (connected to oxygen atoms in the triangular depressions) is necessarily displaced (dotted, dot-dashed, and dashed hexagons). It is displaced in either one of three directions, with vectorsv 1, v2, and v3. As long as you have a single layer, the three possibilities are symmetrically equivalent and simply involve a 120 \u25e6 rotation. But if you stack layers, there are different options. In the simplest case all layers are in the same orientation (v1displacements: vI 1, vII 1 ,vIII 1 , Roman superscripts indicating the layer) and this produces a 1 M polytype with a one-layer repeat (Figure 27.12b). In the common 2 M mica polytype, layers with tetrahedra displaced by v1 and v2 alternate (vI 1, vII 2 ) (Figure 27.12c).

Some common polytypes in mica minerals are listed in Table 27.1. In the polytype symbol, numbers are used to classify the layer repeat, and capital italic letters are used to identify the symmetry. Subscripts are used if different possibilities exist. The nomenclature was originally introduced for SiC polytypes (Ramsdell, 1947) and has been adapted for sheet silicates (Smith and Y oder, 1956). and molecules (see also Chapter 29). Clay miner- als are the products of weathering and hydrother- mal alteration of feldspars, mica, pyroxenes, and volcanic glasses. The clay mineral illite is closely related to muscovite and has formerly also been called hydromuscovite. It contains less aluminum in the tetrahedral site than stoichiometric mus- covite and, correspondingly, less potassium in the interlayer sites. As a result, illites have a general formula K x Al2Alx Si4\u2212x O10(OH)2 (e.g., K0.6Al2Al0.6Si3.4O10(OH)2) .I l l i t e sf o r mv e r y\ufb01 n e - grained masses.

Unlike the structures of talc and pyrophyllite (see Figure 27.8c), montmorillonites have lay- ers of water molecules intercalated between octahedral--tetrahedral sheets (Figure 27.14b). Generally these clays do not have an ideal composition. Some Si 4+ is substituted by Al 3+, and the charge is compensated by hydrated ionic complexes ( M +\u00b7nH2O) and ( M 2+\u00b7nH2O) en- tering the interlayer sites. Generally fewer than one third of the tetrahedral sites are occupied by aluminum, resulting in a general formula M x \u00b7nH2OSi4\u2212y Aly O10(OH)2 where y = x when M + is an interlayer cation, and y = 0.5x when M 2+ occupies interlayer positions.

This process is reversible and, in a dry atmosphere or during heating, both water and hydrated cations leave the structure of montmorillonites, causing the crystals to decrease in volume. In soils rich in montmorillonite such swelling is often desirable to increase percolation. It can be achieved by adding fertilizers with Ca 2+,a si nl i m ea n dg y p - sum.

Dehydration of clay minerals by heating and ionic exchange alter mainly the distance between layers, i.e., the lattice spacing (d 001). Variations of lattice spacings with heating, hydration, and glycolation are diagnostic charac- teristics and used to identify clay minerals in X- ray powder patterns (Table 27.4). Brief description of important sheet silicate minerals In serpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) some Fe 2+ always substitutes for Mg 2+, but in limited amounts. There are three main polymorphs (antigorite, chrysotile, and lizardite), which differ in their long-range crystal structure. Antigorite is the most common of the three. Crystals are usu- ally \ufb01ne grained but occur in dark- to light- green aggregates with shiny curved surfaces. Chrysotile is \ufb01brous and easily recognized (see Figure 27.6), although sometimes \ufb01brous tremo- lite has a similar appearance and can be asso- ciated with chrysotile. Positive identi\ufb01cation of lizardite must rely on X-ray diffraction. Serpentine forms in ultrama\ufb01c rocks as prod- ucts of hydrothermal alteration of olivine and pyroxene. Serpentine asbestos has been used as a refractory material, particularly for high- temperature applications. Today it is largely out- lawed because of perceived carcinogenic health hazards (see Chapter 33). Kaolinite (Al 2Si2O5(OH)4) is often associated with, and is similar to, the related clay miner- als dickite and halloysite. Kaolinite group miner- als cannot be distinguished on the basis of their morphology. They usually occur as \ufb01ne-grained aggregates in \ufb02our-like or clay-like white masses. Identi\ufb01cation is done by X-ray diffraction (see Table 27.4).", "page": 475}

Talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2) may contain Fe 2+ up to 1.5--2 weight%. Talc is found as light-green aggregates with a greasy touch in schists and marbles and as soft large plates with a perfect cleavage and pearly luster in altered dunites. It is easily distinguished from other sheet silicates such as chlorite and serpentine on the basis of its low hardness (1 on the Mohs\u2019 scale; it can be scratched with \ufb01ngernails). In thin sections talc is recognized by lower-order interference col- ors than muscovite, but higher-order interference colors than serpentine. Similar to serpentine, talc is also frequently an alteration product of olivine and pyroxene. It occurs in low-temperature metamorphic rocks (b) (schists and marbles). Talc is used as a refractory material, for brick-lining of blast furnaces, as a lubricant, and in the cosmetic industry. Pyrophyllite (Al 2Si4O10(OH)2), with an Fe 3+ content of less than 0.5 weight%, occurs as cryp- tocrystalline solid masses of pink or greenish- gray color in metamorphic rocks and sometimes as radial aggregates (Figure 27.15a). It forms be- cause of hydrolysis of aluminum silicates in granitic rocks. When present in signi\ufb01cant con- centrations, it is a raw material for manufactur- ing insulators and furnace brick-linings. Stone- carvers call translucent varieties of this mineral \u2018\u2018agalmatolite\u2019\u2019. Pyrophyllite exfoliates on heat- ing. There is a continuous solid solution series of trioctahedral magnesium--iron--aluminum mi- cas phlogopite (KMg 3AlSi3O10(OH, F) 2), sidero- phyllite (KFe2+ 2 AlAl2Si2O10(OH, F) 2), and annite KFe2+ 3 AlSi3O10(OH, F) 2. The intermediate compo- sitions are generally called biotite, also contain- ing some Fe 3+. Phlogopite and biotite are found as platelets with well-developed and sometimes giant, tabular crystals. Their color varies from green to deep brown and black, depending on the iron content. Pure phlogopite is transparent and colorless and can be mistaken for muscovite but is recognized in thin sections by a small axial angle. In thin section colored biotites are pleochroic with brown, yellowish, and green col- ors. The strongest colors are observed when the vibration direction of the polarizer is parallel to the cleavage.", "page": 476}
{"text": "IMPORTANT SHEET SILICATE MINERALS 461 Phlogopite crystals are used as electric in- sulators. Commercially valuable concentrations of large phlogopite crystals are found in some alkali-rich ultrama\ufb01c rocks (e.g., in Kovdor on the Kola Peninsula in Russia and Palabora in South Africa) and at contacts of marbles with gneisses and schists in crystalline shields. Muscovite (KAl 2Si3AlO10(OH, F)2)i sa na l m o s t pure aluminous mica with very little iron (1--3 weight% Fe 2O3). In some rare muscovites, alu- minum is partly substituted by chromium, result- ing in a bright-green color (fuchsite or mariposite). Other muscovites exist in which potassium is partly replaced by sodium. The isomorphic sub- stitution Al 3++ [Al3+] \u21cc Mg2++ [Si4+] produces a series of micas with the common name phengite -- in particular, KAlMgSi4O10(OH)2. Muscovite usually occurs as tabular crystals of light brown or gray color (Figure 27.15b). Thin cleavage platelets of muscovite are color- less. Large crystals and plates are found in granite pegmatites, while scaly aggregates are observed in granites, gneisses, and schists. Sericite i say e l - low \ufb01ne-grained or, sometimes, solid cryptocrys- talline mass composed mainly of muscovite. It forms pseudomorphs after feldspar and alumi- nosilicates during hydrothermal alteration. Muscovite is used as a dielectric material in the electronics industry. It is mined from granite pegmatites. Two lithium-bearing micas are notewor- thy: zinnwaldite is a magnesium--iron-bearing lithium mica (Figure 27.15c), while lepidolite is a group name for lithium--aluminum micas. Owing to geochemical peculiarities of the environment in which lepidolite forms, this mineral always contains some manganese in octahedral sites. The presence of manganese ions causes pink, silverish-pink, and lilac-pink colors that are di- agnostic for the identi\ufb01cation. The micas (phlogopite, biotite, muscovite) form in igneous rocks as primary phases and as secondary postmagmatic minerals owing to in- teraction between solutions and olivines, pyrox- enes, and hornblendes. Many volcanic rocks con- tain phenocrysts of biotite. In particular, large crystals of phlogopite, biotite, and muscovite are found in granite pegmatites. Spodumene-bearing pegmatites contain Li-micas. Metamorphic rocks (gneisses and schists) frequently bear muscovite and biotite as major mineral phases; phlogopites occur in dolomitic marbles. Illites are water-rich sheet-silicates. They are de\ufb01cient in potassium in the interlayer space of the structure. Glauconite is another example of an interlayer-de\ufb01cient mica. Glauconite can be considered as a ferriferous (with Fe 2+ and Fe 3+) illite. It is blue or green in color, and it occurs as tiny roundish aggregates and colloform segre- gations in clays, marls, and dolomites. A water- rich micaceous sheet silicate is vermiculite (Mg, Fe 2+,A l )3(Si, Al) 4O10(OH)2\u00b74H2O, which forms as a result of weathering of phlogopite and biotite in soils. Hydration of the mineral, and substitu- tions in its interlayer sites bring about changes in its physical properties: compared to fresh phlogo- pite, vermiculite is more fragile, less shiny, and its cleavage platelets are not elastic and become crumpled, like wet paper. When vermiculite is heated, it loses the water and may shrink by 10% or more. Clays are", "page": 477}

Two major members of the group are clinochlore (Mg 3(OH)6Mg2Al(OH)2Si3AlO10), and chamosite (Fe2+ 3 (OH)6Fe2+ 2.5 Al0.5(OH)2Si3.5Al0.5O10), which form a solid solution. Chlorites that are rich in mag- nesium are green in color and hence their name. In thin section they are recognized by low birefringence and anomalous brown or ink-blue interference colors owing to dispersion. Iron-rich chlorites are usually oxidized under weathering conditions and have a brown color. There are many other species among chlorites -- nickel, zinc, manganese and lithium substituting for magnesium in the clinochlore formula. Chlorites are products of late-stage low- temperature alteration of olivine, pyroxenes, and hornblendes, as are serpentine, talc, and brucite (greenschist facies).

It is found as a low- grade hydrothermal mineral in veins or cavities of ma\ufb01c volcanic rocks and in altered metamor- phic rocks, often associated with zeolites. Formation conditions for sheet silicates and weathering of silicate rocks Most sheet silicates are low-temperature and low-pressure minerals. Only muscovite, phlogo- pite, biotite, and lithium micas occur in ig- neous rocks. As a whole, endogenetic mineral deposits characteristically bear micas, talc, py- rophyllite, serpentines, and chlorites. Exogenetic conditions are appropriate for the formation of the kaolinite group minerals, montmorillonites, hydromicas, some serpentines and chlorites. Clay minerals form directly by precipitation from sea- water and by alteration of primary minerals. The six-membered tetrahedral Si 6O12\u2212 18 ring is one of the most stable polymers in solution and such rings combine to form either microcrys- talline opal--cristobalite--tridymite-like structures in cherts, or clay minerals with sheet structures in clays, mudstones, and shales. We will now take a closer look at alteration processes at surface conditions.

That is why these minerals are sometimes called col- lectively clay minerals. Aluminous sheet silicates (kaolinite, etc.) develop in weathering crusts of granites and felsic (silicon-rich) volcanics, and they may later be transformed into bauxites. Alteration of minerals and rocks on the earth\u2019s surface, under the in\ufb02uence of physical, chemical, and biological factors, is described as a weathering process. Weathering is usually sub- divided into four separate stages, according to the type of chemical processes involved. At \ufb01rst chemical decomposition of minerals is insigni\ufb01- cant while mechanical weathering dominates. A coherent rock breaks down into fractured rock or loose sand. This is followed by the crystallization of clay minerals. The complete hydrolysis of the silicates causes oxides and hydroxides to form. Typically, aqueous solutions and colloidal solu- tions participate in all these processes. Pervasive surface weathering takes", "page": 478}
{"text": "place when several conditions work in combination. Lack of tectonic activity and weak erosion are im- portant factors. Under surface conditions, zones of weathering form and cover unaltered rocks; these zones can extend to great depths, as much as 1 km, and in some cases their formation lasts over 15--20 million years. In both ancient and recent zones of weather- ing, the intensity of the transformation of the initial rocks increases upwards (Figure 27.16), from the region of little alteration above the primary bedrock towards zones where residual mineral deposits develop. There is often a reg- ular zoning with a mechanical decomposition of pre-existing rocks into grain aggregates (or gruss), a zone of clay minerals, followed by kaoli- nite, and ultimately bauxite--laterite with oxides and hydroxides. In temperate zones with mod- erate rainfall, chemical weathering is usually con\ufb01ned to clay minerals. In arid regions trans- formations are minimal. The thickest weather- ing crusts form in a humid and warm climate such as in tropical rainforests. In those tropical regions with high precipitation, surface weath- ering of granites and other feldspathic rocks, as well as ultrama\ufb01c rocks, cause laterite deposits to form. Presently laterites form in central Africa, Southeast Asia, and northern South and Cen- tral America (Figure 27.17). Alkalis, alkaline-earth", "page": 478}

Clay minerals in soils Having explored some aspects of weathering, it is natural that we extend this excursion by tak- ing a brief look at soils and their mineralogical composition. In fact, of all minerals, clay min- erals in soils have the most profound effect on life. Soils are the outermost thin layer of the solid earth and support the majority of life, in- terfacing the lithosphere, the biosphere, and the atmosphere. Interactions between these systems occur mainly through plants and their root sys- tems. Soils are very complicated systems, and we will address only a few issues directly related to mineralogy. Soil science, or pedology, investi- gates the composition, structure, and evolution of soils, and their relationship to the environ- ment. In soils, most of the reactions take place on the surface of clays and organic matter. Contrary to minerals in most rocks, soil min- erals are extremely \ufb01ne grained ( <2 /H9262m), cre- ating a large surface area (per unit mass) on which reactions can occur. An electron micro- scope is required to image individual crystals. Figure 27.18 is an SEM image of a clay sample composed largely of saponite. Thin lath- or blade- shaped crystals are visible, only a few microme- ters in size. Most clay minerals have a negative charge within the tetrahedral--octahedral layers owing to isomorphic substitutions. The charge is balanced by cations from the surrounding soil", "page": 479}

Soil scientists de\ufb01ne cation exchange capacity (CEC) as the amount of negative charge in the tetrahedral--octahedral lay- ers per 100 g soil. Soil minerals with a higher CEC can hold on to more soil ions and are more re- active, bene\ufb01ting plants. Since the surface area (per unit mass) increases enormously as the par- ticle size decreases, clay minerals vary in their CEC, as is illustrated in Table 27.5. Some clays and organic humus have a variable surface charge that depends on the pH of the surrounding solution. Minerals that are frequently found in soils are listed in Table 27.6. All clays adsorb water on their surface as discussed above, but some (such as smectite and halloysite) also allow water to enter between the layers in the crystal structure. Most of the soil minerals are aluminosilicates, i.e., they contain aluminum in octahedral layers. In kandites, with a 1:1 layer structure (see Fig- ure 27.14a), there is little isomorphous substitu- tion and octahedral--tetrahedral layers as well as 20 \u03bcm Fig. 27.18 SEM image of a trioctahedral aggregate (saponite) from Redrock Canyon, California, USA, with minute lath-shaped crystallites typical of these phyllosilicates (courtesy T.

Therefore the negative charge is further from the crystal sur- face and cations are held less tightly. When soil water content increases, cation concentra- tions decrease through dilution, water enters the spaces between each 2:1 layer, and the clays swell. These soils are very reactive, shrinking when dry and expanding when wet. There are also nonclay minerals in soils. Min- erals such as halite, calcite, and gypsum are typ- ical of soils in climates where evaporation is greater than precipitation. If they occur in sig- ni\ufb01cant concentrations, they have adverse effects on plant growth. Apatite occurs in some soils as a relict from the parent rock and is important because it is one of the few minerals that provide phosphorus, an important nutrient for plants. Soils are a product of inorganic processes (such as physical and chemical weathering), as well as organic processes. Organic reactions are followed by the degradation of organisms and in- corporation of organic matter into the soil.

White areas may still outline euhedral feldspar crystals and dark areas amphiboles and biotite, though these minerals may have disappeared. Some com- ponents of the bedrock are recognized as par- tially unaltered fragments. While much of the alteration occurs in situ,s o m ec l a ym i n e r a l sa r e transported in the percolating solutions. Because of these processes the clay and mineral struc- ture in zone C is highly heterogeneous, depend- ing on the composition of the bedrock and the activity of the solutions. Geochemical processes govern this zone, with little biological activity. Above zone C, the original petrographic structure has disappeared. In this so-called saprolite zone, clays have replaced most of the original minerals (horizon B). Some clays are still remnants of the original rock formed in local chemical reactions, but others are the result of mechanical transport, and clay minerals present in this horizon may not have formed under the same chemical condi- tions. The composition of the B horizon depends both on migration of cations in solution from be- low and from above. Iron and aluminum are of- ten concentrated in this zone. The B horizon may contain some organic matter, introduced from above, and occasionally carbonate and gypsum. Above this B argillic zone is sometimes a horizon (E) that has been leached of organic matter, sili- cate clay, as well as aluminum and iron, leaving a concentration of resistant sand and silt parti- cles. The E horizon can also contain concentra- tions of calcium carbonate (caliche) in arid envi- ronments. The uppermost weathering horizon A contains much of what is commonly called \u2018\u2018soil\u2019\u2019. The mineral horizon A is close to the surface and has accumulated organic matter such as humus. This accumulation is caused by high biological activity, resulting in acid conditions leading to r a p i dw e a t h e r i n go fm i n e r a l sa n dl e a c h i n go fs o l - uble products.

The characteristics and extent of each hori- zon are determined by numerous factors, among which composition of bedrock, climate (tempera- ture and rainfall), organisms, time, and topog- raphy are the most important. Soil scientists consider how these factors differentially affect soil-forming processes and create different soil horizons. For instance, both time and precipita- tion affect hydrolytic weathering and soil min- eral formation. Hydrolytic weathering results in some loss of silicon and alkalis from the initial rock, whereas aluminum and iron remain. In to- tal hydrolysis, all silicon and alkalis are lost, re- sulting in precipitation of gibbsite and goethite, typical components of laterites. If hydrolysis is less pervasive, only alkalies are lost, while some silicon remains. In such cases kaolinite is the typical mineral. If hydrolysis is even weaker, smectite-type clay minerals form. Soil taxonomists have developed a system of 12 soil orders with which to classify soils based on their physical and chemical characteristics along the soil pro\ufb01le.

Andisols are special soils formed from a volcanic parent ma- terial. They have poorly crystallized minerals or amorphous components, which lead to low bulk density and high water holding capacity.

{"text": "Chapter 28 Chain silicates. Discussion of some igneous and metamorphic processes Structural and chemical features In Chapter 27 we discussed the structures of sheet silicates with in\ufb01nite two-dimensional lay- ers of hexagonal tetrahedral nets. We noted that there are some deviations from in\ufb01nite nets in the structures of paligorskite and sepiolite, where, instead of in\ufb01nite sheets, \ufb01nite strips are stacked in a brickwork fashion (see Figure 27.9). In chain silicates such strips are much narrower and extend only over one or two tetrahedra. From an in\ufb01nite tetrahedral sheet, say of talc (Figure 28.1a), we can obtain simple strips in various ways. Figure 28.1b--d illustrates some of the pos- sibilities for which there are mineral representa- tives. In Figure 28.1b a band consisting of four tetrahedra is cut from the sheet in the vertical direction. By doing so we obtain a double chain, which is present in amphibole minerals.I nF i g u r e 28.1c a narrow band of two tetrahedra forms a single chain, representative of pyroxenes. Finally, in Figure 28.1d a strip of three tetrahedra is cut from the sheet in the horizontal direction, at right angles to pyroxenes and amphiboles. Also this scheme is observed in nature in the rare iron- rich mineral howieite (NaMg 10Fe3+ 2 Si12O34(OH)10). As in sheet silicates, tetrahedra in chain sil- icates are attached on both sides of octahedral units. This is illustrated for pyroxenes in Fig- ure 28.2a,b and for amphiboles in Figure 28.2c,d. The chain units run along the c- a x i so fc r y s t a l s and are parallel to (100). When viewed along c, the units are regularly stacked (Figure 28.2b,d). In pyroxenes (Figure 28.2b) the structure is fairly compact with tetrahedral atoms ( T ) and octahe- dral atoms ( M 1a n d M 2), and the compositions are relatively simple (Table 28.2). In amphiboles (Figure 28.2d) the structure is more open, with several M sites and a larger space between op- posite chains (A) that can accommodate large cations such as Na + and K+. Also, there is space for OH\u2212 in the octahedral units. Because of these ionic substitutions the chemical formulas of am- phiboles are more complex (Table 28.1). Figure 28.3 is a more schematic view of the stacking perpendicular to the chain direction. The preferred cleavage planes in chain silicates are those through which no Si---O bonds need to be broken. Since [001] is the chain direction and (100) the plane of octahedral and tetrahedral lay- ers, cleavages traverse the structure diagonally parallel to (110) and (1\u00af10) and, owing to the width of the chains, are at about an 88 \u25e6 angle in pyrox- enes with narrow chains (Figure 28.3a) and a 125\u25e6 angle in amphiboles with wider chains (Figure 28.3b). We noted in Chapter 10 that this cleavage angle is diagnostic for identi\ufb01cation of pyroxenes (Plate 4a) and amphiboles (Plate 2i).

This quadrilateral is particularly interesting with respect to phase transformations that occur dur- ing cooling of basaltic lava. At high temperatures, all pyroxene compo- sitions in the pyroxene quadrilateral are possi- ble. During cooling, an initially homogeneous pyroxene may exsolve into a calcium-enriched diopside (\u2018\u2018augite\u201d) 1 and a calcium-poor enstatite or pigeonite, in a manner analogous to alkali feldspars decomposing into sodium-rich albite and potassium-rich orthoclase (see Chapters 17 and 18).

An additional complication is that enstatite, pigeonite, and \u2018\u2018augite\u201d (isostructural with diopside) have slightly different crystal struc- tures and space-group symmetries.

Upon cooling, pigeonite undergoes a phase trans- formation (from C 2/c to P 2 1/c), and since the symmetry changes, the phase transformation gives rise to antiphase boundaries (APBs; see Chapter 6).

As with the sodic pyroxene jadeite, sodic amphiboles such a glaucophane and riebeckite are typically in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. They are eas- ily recognized in hand specimens by their bluish color and in thin section by a blue pleochroism, which distinguishes sodic amphiboles from cal- cic amphiboles with green pleochroism. The wide range of cationic substitutions is summarized in Figure 28.10. A quadrilateral representing minerals and compositions of calcic amphiboles is shown in Figure 28.11. It has some analogies with that for pyroxenes (see Figure 28.5). Like the magnesium pyroxene enstatite, the magnesium amphibole anthophyllite is orthorhombic, while all others are monoclinic. Hornblende contains some K + in the A site and has a very variable composition (K, Na)0\u22121(Ca, Na)2(Mg, Fe+)(Al, Fe3+)Si7AlO22 (OH, F)2 that depends on rock composition and condi- tions of formation. Hornblende, similar to the pyroxenes \u2018\u2018augite\u201d and \u2018\u2018omphacite\u201d discussed earlier, has also recently been discredited as a mineral species, but we keep it as a group name that is widely used in petrology and every student needs to be familiar with it. Calcic amphiboles such as tremolite, actinolite, and hornblende are characteristic of many regionally metamor- phosed rocks of the amphibolite facies. As you can imagine, the different structural units and combinations of such features as sin- gle, double, triple, and even quadruple chains, along with principles of polytypism similar to sheet silicates, open many possibilities for differ- ent structures as well as structural defects in am- phiboles and pyroxenes. For example, the stack- ing of octahedra and their orientation that leads to polytypism in sheet silicates (see Box 27.1) crea- tes monoclinic (clino-) and orthorhombic (ortho-) pyroxenes and amphiboles. Hybrids, intermedi- ate between single, double, and triple chains and sheet silicates, have been found in metamorphic rocks with transmission electron microscopy (Fig- ure 28.12) and have been labeled biopyriboles by J. Thompson (1978). Figure 28.13 shows the schematic stacking in the biopyriboles jimthomp- sonite and chesterite, as compared with that for enstatite and anthophyllite. Although rare, these minerals caution against a universal application of simple structural classi\ufb01cations. Not all chain silicates can be classi\ufb01ed as pyroxenes and amphiboles. There are more complicated types of chain, and we have already mentioned howieite earlier in this chapter (see Figure 28.1d). In pyroxenoids, chains are not lin- ear but show kinks and are differently attached to octahedral layers (Figure 28.14). Friedrich Liebau (1962) has classi\ufb01ed chain silicates accord- ing to the number of connected tetrahedra in the chain with a distinct organizational pattern that repeats. Figure 28.14 shows different tetra- hedral single chains attached to octahedral units. (Tetrahedral chains are attached on both sides of the octahedral layer; only the topside is shown in this \ufb01gure.)

Multiples in the chemical formu- las are sometimes used to express this repeat (i.e., Ca 3Si3O9 rather than CaSiO 3 for wollastonite).

Sodic amphiboles have a characteristic blue color and in thin section they display a distinct blue/yellow pleochroism (Plate 3a) (glaucophane, riebeckite, crocidolite). The luster of the pyroxenes and amphiboles is vitreous; however, the amphiboles (in particu- lar, iron-rich hornblendes and alkali amphiboles) have a stronger luster.

Pyroxenes and amphiboles occur in similar types of rock: igneous rocks, skarns, gneisses, and schists. Amphiboles crystallize at shallower depths than do pyroxenes. Amphiboles some- times replace pyroxenes during retrograde meta- morphic processes, taking place with decreasing pressure and temperature and increasing chem- ical activity of H 2O.

The chemical composition of pyroxenes and amphiboles is characteristic of the rock types in which they are found. In ultrama\ufb01c and ma\ufb01c plutonic rocks, pyroxenes are iron- and magnesium bearing (enstatite, hypersthene, diopside--hedenbergite). At high pressures, the pyroxene structure accommodates some sodium and aluminum, as in \u2018\u2018omphacite\u201d, which occurs in mantle-derived ultrama\ufb01c rocks such as eclog- ites. Monoclinic clinoenstatite (Mg 2Si2O6)i ss t a b l e at very high pressure and may transform from orthorhombic enstatite under the in\ufb02uence of stress. It has been observed in meteorites and highly deformed mylonites. Alkaline plutonic rocks (syenites and nepheline syenites) contain the alkali pyrox- enes aegirine--diopside, diopside--hedenbergite-- aegirine, and aegirine. Amphiboles in these rocks are also alkali rich (e.g., arfvedsonite). In volcanic rocks such as basalts, common py- roxenes are pigeonites, \u2018\u2018augites\u201d, and titanium- bearing \u2018\u2018augites\u201d.

Sodium--lithian granite pegmatites always contain spodumene as one of the major miner- als. Alkali pegmatites may contain aegirine, arf- vedsonite, and other alkali amphiboles. In skarns, diopside and hedenbergite are char- acteristic components. They form at the earli- est stage of skarn formation and are often re- placed with hornblende, actinolite, and tremolite at later stages. The presence of light green, low- iron diopside with a well-developed parting (dial- lage) is typical of some skarns. Parting surfaces are often decorated with magnetite inclusions. In rocks undergoing prograde regional meta- morphism, pyroxenes and amphiboles form in the following order: actinolite (or tremolite) -- hornblende -- diopside -- hypersthene. This series corresponds to increasing temperature and pres- sure of regional metamorphism, but it applies only to rocks that were initially enriched in cal- cium and magnesium. Sodic pyroxenes and am- phiboles, such as jadeite and glaucophane, are characteristic minerals of the blueschist meta- morphic facies and are indicative of high pres- sure and low temperature. Pyroxenes and amphiboles easily become al- tered by hydrothermal solutions with decreas- ing temperature and pressure to micas, chlorite, sometimes serpentine, and talc, the last of these typically replacing the magnesian orthopyroxene enstatite. Only a few metamorphic deposits of the py- roxenes and amphiboles are of economic impor- tance. They are a source of jade and nephrite. Jade is a massive \ufb01brous aggregate of jadeite; nephrite consists of intimately interwoven actinolite nee- dles; both are gemstones that are especially val- ued in Burma and China. Spodumene is an ore of lithium and can occur in pegmatites as very large crystals, several meters long. Also, in the past, riebeckite and crocidolite asbestos (so-called blue asbestos) have been of importance. Like chrysotile asbestos, crocidolite asbestos was used as acid- resistant \ufb01lters in chemical puri\ufb01cation and as a refractory material in construction, but its appli- cation has been greatly reduced because of health risks (see Chapter 33). Wollastonite (Ca 3Si3O9) is characteristic of ig- neous contacts with limestone, occurring in mar- bles and skarns. It forms \ufb01brous and prismatic crystals; they are white with vitreous luster and perfect cleavage. Wollastonite is a valuable ce- ramic raw material. Rhodonite (Ca 4MnSi5O15), from the Greek \u03c1\u00b4o\u03b4o\u03bd (rhodon, meaning rose), occurs in contact and regionally metamorphic rocks. It is easily rec- ognized by its pink (rose) color and solid gran- ular masses. Black veinlets of manganese diox- ide (MnO 2) often cross these masses. Rhodonite is used as a decorative stone.

{"text": "484 CHAIN SILICATES. IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC PROCESSES it is useful to discuss, at this point, some of the processes taking place during crystallization of magma. While magma is cooling, minerals separate from the melt in a certain order that is deter- mined by the physical and chemical rules of crystallization of compositionally complex mul- tiphase melts. Mineral crystallization in plutonic rocks at depth proceeds from about 1300 to 700 \u25e6C, whereas most volcanic lavas crystallize be- tween 1200 and 1000 \u25e6C. The mineral composi- tion of a resultant igneous rock depends on the composition of the initial magma (and particu- larly its SiO 2 content). Contrary to metamorphic rocks, igneous rocks, on the whole, contain a rel- atively small number of major minerals (about 10 silicates, such as olivine, pyroxene, hornblende, muscovite, biotite, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, nepheline, and quartz). This limited mineral di- versity in igneous rocks arises because of the relatively limited range of initial magma com- positions. The \ufb01rst minerals to crystallize grow in free space in the melt and are generally euhedral. Since a siliceous melt is very viscous, crystals re- main suspended in the melt or sink only slowly. During growth of nonequiaxed crystals (platelets or needles) in a \ufb02owing magma, the crystals be- come aligned by the \ufb02ow currents. With contin- ued crystallization, free growth becomes limited. Minerals that crystallize later are only partially euhedral, or occur as irregular grains that occupy the interstices between the earlier formed min- erals. Plutonic rocks are classi\ufb01ed according to the dominant rock-forming minerals in modal pro- portions. In Chapter 19 we discussed granitic rocks with various proportions of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase (see Figure 19.22). We now expand this system to consider rocks that are de\ufb01cient in these minerals and have a high proportion of ma\ufb01c minerals, such as olivine, py- roxene, and hornblende. Mafic rocks are composed largely of plagio- clase, pyroxene, and hornblende, and a corre- sponding triangle is used for their classi\ufb01cation (Figure 28.16a).

The composition of volcanic rocks is more variable, and modal compositions in particular are more dif\ufb01cult to establish, since glass may be present and a classi\ufb01cation has to rely on modal as well as on chemical data. Without going into details, basalt and andesite correspond roughly to gabbro, dacite to granodiorite, and rhyolite to granite. In Chapter 19 we explored crystallization of igneous rocks composed of quartz, plagioclase (albite), and alkali feldspar (see Figure 19.23). How do we characterize crystallization of ma\ufb01c mag- mas? The major phases in ma\ufb01c rocks, such as basalt and gabbro, are plagioclase (solid solution anorthite--albite) and diopside containing alu- minum and iron (in the older literature known as augite). The ternary system diopside (CaMgSi 2O6)-- albite (NaAlSi 3O8)--anorthite (CaAl 2Si2O8) has been studied in great detail and illustrates many features of the crystallization of ma\ufb01c rocks. This system is not completely new to us. At high temperature, the binary system albite-- anorthite forms a solid solution that was dis- cussed in Chapter 18 (see Box 18.1), where liquidus and solidus curves were introduced, ex- plaining the gradual changes in plagioclase com- position during cooling (see Figure 18.2). Also, the binary system anorthite--diopside has been discussed earlier (see Figure 17.6). This system does not form a solid solution and, depending on magma composition, either anorthite or diop- side will crystallize and grow. When the magma cools and has reached a critical temperature at the eutectic point, the residual anorthite and diopside components that remain in the liquid crystallize simultaneously to form groundmass composed of the two minerals. The binary system albite--diopside is similar. We need to combine a binary system without solid solution (diopside-- plagioclase) with a binary system of solid solution (albite--anorthite). This ternary system is shown in Figure 28.17a, with temperature as the third dimension. Note the binary phase diagrams that were discussed earlier at the sides of this dia- gram. Contrary to those diagrams, there is no eutectic point in the ternary system, but rather", "page": 500}

The microstructures that we are expecting to \ufb01nd are as follows. The \ufb01rst crystals to form in the melt are plagioclase and we expect them to grow as euhedral phenocrysts. As the magma cools, plagioclase becomes more sodic and we expect regular zoning, with a calcic core and a more sodic rim. At point B, diopside begins to crystallize. When point C is reached, the re- maining plagioclase (albite) and diopside will crystallize simultaneously and instantaneously, resulting in an interwoven groundmass. (For a discussion of these mineral intergrowths, see Chapters 17 and 18.) A second system relevant for ma\ufb01c rocks is forsterite (Mg 2SiO4)--anorthite (CaAl 2Si2O8)-- cristobalite (SiO 2). Figure 28.18a shows the ternary temperature--composition phase diagram at atmospheric pressure, where the surface repre- sents the liquidus. Some reference temperatures are indicated. The liquidus surface is much more complicated than in the system discussed previ- ously. Before looking at the larger picture, let us explore the binary system forsterite--silica, on the front side of Figure 28.18a. A small sector of this system is enlarged in Figure 28.19. This sys- tem is different from a simple eutectic system such as diopside--anorthite (see Figure 17.6) be- cause it contains an intermediate phase, enstatite (Mg 2Si2O6), at 30 weight% SiO 2. If the melt has a composition X1 and cools, enstatite will start to crystallize at 1554 \u25e6C. Enstatite will continue to crystallize, thereby changing the composition of the melt, until the eutectic point E is reached at 1543 \u25e6C. At this point enstatite and silica, as cristobalite, crystallize simultaneously. Now con- sider a composition X 2 for the original melt.

At this point the liquid starts to react with forsterite, which is no longer stable, and enstatite is produced. The reaction point P is called the peritectic point.

{"text": "488 CHAIN SILICATES. IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC PROCESSES Box 28.1 Free energy and melting Melting can be understood in terms of free energy. Consider, for example, what happens when we heat a crystal of diopside (CaMgSi 2O6). For most solids the free energy decreases with increasing temperature but less than the free energy of the corresponding liquid does (see Figure 28.21a and review in Chapter 17). At some temperature the free energy of the solid crystal becomes larger than the free energy of the corresponding liquid. Where the two free energy curves cross, melting occurs. At that temperature ( T m = 1392 \u25e6C), crystal and melt coexist in equilibrium. The melting behavior is different for enstatite (Mg 2Si2O6), because another phase, forsterite (Mg2SiO4), enters the picture. For a certain temperature range it is energetically favorable to have solid forsterite coexist with a more siliceous melt according to the dissociation Mg 2Si2O6 \u21cc Mg2SiO4(solid) + SiO2 (in melt). Figure 28.21b shows the free energy\u2013temperature diagram for solid and liquid enstatite, as well as for a solid forsterite+ liquid mixture. The pointT m, at the intersection of the free energy lines for solid and liquid enstatite, would be the equilibrium melting point of enstatite. However, the free energy curve for a compositionally equiva- lent solid forsterite + liquid mixture has a steeper slope than the solid enstatite curve and above a temperature T i (1557 \u25e6C) melting begins, with simultaneous crystallization of forsterite because the free energy is lower than that for solid or liquid enstatite. With rising temperature the proportion and composition of the liquid that coexists with forsterite change and so do the corresponding free energy curves. The melt is \ufb01rst very siliceous but continuously approaches the composition of enstatite. The slopes of the free energy curves become steeper and de\ufb01ne a curved minimum free energy envelope that converges on the enstatite liquid curve at T 1. At that temperature all forsterite has been cconsumed by the melt aboveT1 a homogeneous enstatite melt has the lowest free energy. Such melting behavior is called incongruent melting, as opposed to congruent melting like in diopside. Let us return to the larger ternary system (see Figure 28.18a). There are four surfaces (for anor- thite, forsterite, cristobalite, and enstatite) sep- arated by boundaries. Consider a melt of com- position A. Forsterite crystallizes and the melt changes composition towards B. At B, olivine starts to react with the melt to form enstatite. Descending along the boundary P--P \u2217, olivine con- tinuously reacts with the melt to form enstatite. At P \u2217 anorthite starts to crystallize.

When the liquid reaches the peritectic line at B, enstatite starts to crystallize and this contin- ues as the liquid moves towards P \u2217. The bulk solid composition moves towards En as indicated by the arrow in Figure 28.18b, until it reaches X 2 (obtained by extrapolating the straight dot- t e dl i n eP\u2217--A). At the peritectic P \u2217 the liquid does not change composition and anorhite crys- tallizes, in addition to olivine and enstatite, mov- ing the bulk solid from X 2 towards P\u2217. When the solids reach A (X 3), the composition of the ini- tial melt, all liquid is used up and crystallization stops. During this crystallization, there are also sys- tematic changes in grain shapes and mineral intergrowths. The olivine crystals that form initially at point A are euhedral, but when the melt reaches the reaction curve at B, they become rounded owing to the reaction with the residual melt and are rimmed with enstatite that forms during this reaction. At point P \u2217, plagioclase crys- tallizes in the spaces between enstatite (Figure 28.20). In the example above, with an initial melt composition A, the eutectic point E \u2217 is never reached. This is different if the initial compo- sition is in the subtriangle En--Cr--An. In that case enstatite, cristobalite and anorthite are the equilibrium phases and crystallization proceeds to the eutectic point. Similar arguments as ex- plained above can be used to follow the sys- tematic evolution in composition of melt and solids. The two systems, which we have described in Figures 28.17 and 28.18, were \ufb01rst studied experimentally by Norman L. Bowen and his coworkers at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution in Washington. They be- came the basis for a general model of magma evolution, which became known as Bowen\u2019s re- action principle. Bowen (1928) proposed that a primary ma\ufb01c magma becomes increas- ingly siliceous through fractional crystallization. In the crystallization sequence he described two trends: continuous and discontinuous series. There is a continuous change in plagioclase composition with crystallization of a melt, as we have seen in Figure 28.17. In a melt of basaltic composition, a calcium-rich plagioclase crystal- lizes \ufb01rst and becomes increasingly sodic, by continuously reacting with the magma, as crys- tallization proceeds. We have already noted that this process leads to zoning of crystals, with an anorthite-rich core and an albite-rich rim (Plate 3e). This continuous series is illustrated schemati- cally on the right side of Figure 28.22. Parallel to this continuous crystallization, there is a discontinuous series, which applies to ferromagnesian minerals. With the ternary system in Figure 28.18 and the binary system in Figure 28.19, we have documented that in a ma\ufb01c magma olivine crystallizes \ufb01rst, followed by orthopyroxene. In a more complete sequence olivine crystallizes at the highest temperature (\ufb01rst magnesium-rich,", "page": 504}
{"text": "later more iron-rich), followed by orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, am- phibole, and biotite. This is illustrated on the left side of Figure 28.22 in Bowen\u2019s discontinuous branch. We note that in both the discontinuous and the continuous series, the percentage of silicon in the melt increases progressively with decreas- ing temperature. In the discontinuous series, or- thosilicates are followed by single-chain silicates, double-chain silicates, sheet silicates, and \ufb01nally framework silicates. Some residual phases such as water and components corresponding to al- kali feldspar, muscovite, and quartz remain in the melt, which increasingly becomes an aque- ous hydrothermal solution. Since the crystallization sequence goes more or less parallel with density of the minerals, there is a tendency for early forming minerals such as olivine to settle to the bottom of the magma chamber owing to gravity, with the re- maining melt becoming more siliceous as a re- sult. This process is called magmatic differentiation. At lower temperatures, melts are generally too viscous for gravitational settling to occur. Bowen (1928) surmised that crystallization of a basaltic magma through differentiation could explain all igneous rocks, for example peridotites as accu- mulates of olivine and pyroxene that have been removed from the melt through gravitational", "page": 504}

Today it is appreci- ated that the origin of igneous rocks is much more complicated and diverse than has previ- ously been thought. There are many complicating factors, such as mixing of magmas, melting of adjacent country rocks, removal or addition of volatile phases, and the fact that, for kinetic reasons, minerals that are lower in the series can crystallize at the same time as those higher in the series. Metamorphic reactions in siliceous limestones Bowen\u2019s reaction series highlights some system- atic trends in the crystallization of ma\ufb01c mag- mas. As we will see, there is an analog to this pattern in metamorphic rocks. Since we have now discussed most of the rock-forming miner- als and since chain silicates also play an impor- tant role in metamorphic rocks, it is appropri- ate to return brie\ufb02y to some reactions that occur in progressive metamorphism. In Chapter 26 we examined metamorphism in aluminous rocks, where minerals such as garnet, aluminosilicates, staurolite, and vesuvianite are commonly found.

In Figure 28.24 it is assumed that the total pressure is equal to the CO 2 pressure. In a real metamorphic rock this may not be the case. For example, part of the gas may be water vapor. Or t h es y s t e mm a yn o tb ec l o s e da n ds o m eC O 2 gas escapes. This has a profound effect on the phase diagram, as is illustrated for the wollastonite re- action [18.9] in Figure 28.25. If we assume a total pressure of 0.2 GPa, as is typical for amphibolite facies metamorphism, then the equilibrium tem- perature for the breakdown of calcite is reduced, as the partial pressure of CO 2 decreases from 100% (750 \u25e6C), to 50% (680 \u25e6C) and 0% (430 \u25e6C). The lowest temperature corresponds to heating calcite and quartz, with all CO 2 escaping. If the CO2 gas pressure is 0%, then the system consists of three solid phases (calcite, quartz, and wollas- tonite), and the phase boundary is a straight line (cf. Chapter 17). Since the volumes of quartz and calcite are larger than that of wollastonite, the boundary has a negative slope (i.e., with increas- ing pressure, the stability \ufb01eld of wollastonite in- creases, contrary to the case where CO 2 gas is present in the system). If we look at these reactions in the tempera- ture--pressure phase diagram (Figure 28.24), we notice that, by increasing temperature at a given pressure, progressively talc, tremolite, diopside, and forsterite become stable in these metamor- phic marbles. In other words, the sequence is \ufb01rst sheet silicates, followed by amphiboles, pyrox- enes, and \ufb01nally orthosilicates, similar to the dis- continuous reaction series in igneous rocks (see Figure 28.22).

{"text": "Chapter 29 Framework silicates. Zeolites and ion exchange properties of minerals The framework structure Framework silicates contain a three-dimensional framework of tetrahedra, in which all oxygen atoms are bonded to two tetrahedral cations, re- sulting in a general formula with a T:O ratio 1:2. Tetrahedral ions can be silicon or aluminum with Al 3+ \u2264 Si4+. Quartz, SiO 2,i sa ne x a m p l e with no aluminum, while anorthite (CaSi 2Al2O8) is an example where aluminum and silicon are equal. The aluminum-containing framework sil- icates are referred to as alumosilicates with all aluminum atoms tetrahedral, contrary to the alu- mosilicates discussed in Chapter 26, where at least some aluminum is octahedral. The com- position of framework silicates is quite simple compared to pyroxenes and amphiboles: the ma- jor cations are silicon and aluminum; in addi- tion, large cavities in the framework may con- tain cations (e.g., K +,N a +,C a 2+,B a 2+,S r 2+)a s well as anions and anion groups (e.g., Cl \u2212,C O2\u2212 3 , SO2\u2212 4 ,N H + 4 and H 2O molecules). This is illus- trated for scapolite in Figure 29.1. There are no octahedral building units that are an important part of all other silicate structures and there- fore framework silicates do not contain octahe- dral cations (e.g., Mg 2+,F e2+). Among framework silicates, feldspars are most relevant and they have already been discussed in Chapter 19. (We will re- view some aspects of feldspar structures in this chapter.) Feldspathoids (e.g., nepheline, leucite) are a related group of anhydrous framework silicates, the main difference being that they are de\ufb01- cient in SiO 2, and the structure needs to be able to accommodate more large alkali cations than do the alkali feldspars. Zeolites are another im- portant group. They are characterized by open frameworks with large cavities and open chan- nels that contain variable amounts of H 2O that are easily and reversibly lost upon heating (hence the name from the Greek \u03b6\u03b5\u02c6/H9259/H9271(zein, meaning to boil) and \u03bb\u00b4/H9259/H9258/H9265\u03c2 (lithos, meaning a stone)).

These cages, together with additional rings, can be combined to form larger units with different complexity as in gmelinite (Figure 29.4a), and chabazite (Figure 29.4b). In cubic sodalite cube-octahedral cages with four- and six-membered rings are linked together over four-membered rings (Figure 29.4c). In mazzite, 12-membered rings delimit large channels (Fig- ure 29.4d). Indeed, there is almost no limit to the different conceivable architectures, and many of these are observed in natural and synthetic zeo- lites. The tetrahedral frameworks of silicates can therefore contain several types of cage (Figure 29.3b). Some of them contain only large cations, while others also contain unusual anion groups, such as in scapolite minerals (see Figure 29.1), so- dalite, cancrinite, and many others, mostly per- taining to the feldspathoid group of minerals. The cages are particularly large in zeolites (up to 9 \u02daA in cross-section) and are also intercon- nected. These cavities contain groups and com- plexes of ions and water molecules. Natrolite is a typical example of a zeolite structure with an open framework and channels that contain water (Figure 29.5).", "page": 514}

The square outlines a quarter of the unit cell. In zeolites, these intercavity cations, ion com- plexes, and molecules can exchange with sur- rounding solutions. A four-membered ring is too small to admit the passage of any atom. Six-membered rings have apertures 2.2--2.7 \u02daA across, when the peripheries of the framework oxygen atoms are taken into account. This is still too small for any atom except hydrogen to pass through. The eight-membered rings are 3.7--4.1 \u02daA across. Argon and methane are rapidly absorbed in cages with eight-membered rings; larger molecules are excluded. The structural fea- ture that lets small molecules pass, while large ones are kept back, permits zeolite to act as a molecular sieve, a property that has several tech- nological applications. The T/O ratio for all alumosilicates (with Al 3+ in the tetrahedral sites) is 1:2. However, tetrahe- dral ions can either be Si 4+ or Al 3+ and thus the composition of the framework differs. For example, the ratio Si:Al is 1:1 in nepheline (a silicon-de\ufb01cient feldspathoid), 3:1 in albite, and 1:0 in silica minerals. There is never more alu- minum than silicon because this situation would produce structures with adjacent AlO 5\u2212 4 tetrahe- dra, and Al---O---Al bonds are highly unstable (the \u2018\u2018aluminum avoidance principle\u201d; Loewenstein, 1954). In some framework silicates with solid so- lutions (for instance, plagioclase with the albite (Na(AlSi 3O8))--anorthite (Na(AlSi3O8)) series or the members of the scapolites with the marialite (Na 4(AlSi3O8)3Cl)--meionite (Ca4(Al2Si2O8)3CO3) se- ries) the ratio between aluminum and silicon changes continuously. Morphology and physical properties The diversity of the crystal structures in the framework silicates is the cause for the widely different morphologies. Isometrically developed crystals are typical for leucite (Plate 16f), so- dalite, lazurite, and analcime (Figure 29.6a) ex- pressing the cubic or pseudocubic symmetry. In comparison, feldspar crystals, though often more or less equant, always have oblique angles be- tween faces, consistent with monoclinic or tri- clinic symmetry.

{"text": "502 FRAMEWORK SILICATES. ZEOLITES AND ION EXCHANGE (b) (a) (c) or platy habit is present in heulandite, stilbite, and clinoptilolite (Figure 29.6c). Some physical properties are fairly uniform among framework silicates. Strong covalent--ionic bonds and the open cell structure combine to give the framework silicates a medium hardness (4.5--6 on the Mohs\u2019 scale) and a low density (2.1--2.6 g/cm 3). The bond type and composition of the framework silicates also determine the vit- reous luster and transparence or translucence of these minerals. They are usually white because transition elements do not enter their structures. However, some framework alumosilicates do dis- play colors related to the presence of color cen- ters (see Chapter 11). For example, the ink-blue and dark-blue color of sodalite and lazurite is due to such color centers. The cellular structures can accommodate anions that are bigger than oxygen ions. For example, chloride (Cl \u2212), with an ionic radius of 1.81 \u02daA, is present in sodalite and marialite (see Figure 29.1), and the persul\ufb01de Fig. 29.6 The crystal structure is expressed in the morphology of framework silicates, such as in (a) cubic analcime from Ischia, Italy (width 60 /H9262m), (b) \ufb01brous natrolite from M\u00a8 uckenhalm (Germany) (width 75 mm), and (c) tabular clinoptilolite from Creede, Colorado, USA (width 30 /H9262m) ((b) is courtesy O. Medenbach; (a) and (c) are SEM images from Gottardi and Galli (1985)). ion S 2\u2212 2 , with an interatomic distance of 2.06 \u02daA, occurs in lazurite. Inhomogeneities and cages of various shapes weaken the chemical bonds in framework silicates and result in good cleavages along two or more directions. Luster on cleavage planes is vitreous. The above-described similarities in properties of framework alumosilicates are easily explained in terms of their structural similarity and the dominance of the same large cations (Na +,K +, Ca2+), but these similarities also make their iden- ti\ufb01cation dif\ufb01cult. Many minerals of the framework silicate group are important rock-forming minerals. Feldspars (already discussed in Chapter 19) are the main constituents of most igneous and metamorphic rocks. Nepheline is predominant in some alkaline rocks, and leucite occurs in some low-silica basalts. Several of the framework silicate min- erals are valuable raw materials, including microcline for the ceramics industry and zeolites", "page": 516}

Brief description of important framework silicate minerals (for feldspars, see Chapter 19) Leucite (KAlSi2O6) forms trapezohedral crystals of almost ideal shape (Plate 16f). These crystals are composed of thin twinned plates of tetragonal symmetry that form as a result of transformation from an original crystal of cubic symmetry. Such crystals form phenocrysts in some volcanic and plutonic rocks of basaltic composition. Leucite crystals are translucent, colorless, and have a vit- reous luster. Leucite is not very stable under many condi- tions. As basalt cools, leucite phenocrysts may re- act with the melt and leucite may be replaced by sanidine. Leucite crystals in already solidi\ufb01ed r o c k sa l s om a yc h a n g ei n t oa g g r e g a t e so fm i c r o - cline, muscovite, and zeolites under the in\ufb02u- ence of residual alkaline solutions. Finally, anal- cime, kaolinite, and carbonates can easily replace leucite during weathering. This process produces fertile soils, rich in the potassium that has been r e m o v e df r o ml e u c i t e . Leucite can easily be identi\ufb01ed because of its crystal habit and its occurrence in volcanic rocks. Leucite never coexists with quartz because these two minerals would react to produce K-feldspar. Nepheline (Na 3K(AlSiO4)4) is a typical mineral of alkaline rocks. Grains are often anhedral, but well-developed nepheline crystals with square or hexagonal sections are sometimes observed in al- kali volcanic rocks and syenites. Since nepheline is easily dissolved on weathering surfaces, it may leave pseudomorphic holes with a characteristic hexagonal shape. Deeper inside rocks, nepheline is frequently covered with a \ufb01lm of powder- like secondary minerals. Fresh nepheline surfaces have a \ufb02esh-red or greenish color and a greasy luster. Nepheline does not have a cleavage and this distinguishes it from feldspars (though sani- dine may display only poor cleavage). Nepheline may be mistaken for quartz, but quartz has a higher hardness and is resistant to weathering. As with leucite, nepheline never co- exists with quartz because the two would react to form albite and K-feldspar: Na3K(AlSiO4)3 + 8SiO2 \u2192 3NaAlSi3O8 + KAlSi3O8 Nepheline Quartz Albite K-feldspar Nepheline is a major constituent of nepheline syenites and associated pegmatites and in such rocks it may form deposits that are used for the extraction of aluminum. Scapolites comprise a continuous isomor- phic series marialite (Na 4(AlSi3O8)3Cl)--meionite (Ca4(Al2Si2O8)3CO3). Compositionally the scapo- lites are analogs of plagioclases but contain addi- tional anions Cl \u2212,CO2\u2212 3 , and SO 2\u2212 4 ; nonetheless, they have an entirely different structure (cf. Fig- ures 29.1 and 19.10a). Scapolites are tetragonal with prismatic or columnar crystals. They are white, greenish, or pink, with vitreous luster. A weak {100} or {110} cleavage is sometimes ob- served. In thin section scapolite is distinguished from feldspars with interference \ufb01gures (uniax- ial). Scapolite minerals occur", "page": 517}

Macroscopic crystals are sometimes observed in nepheline syenites, tra- chytes, and phonolites. Exceptional transparent crystals have been found in the lavas of Mt Vesu- vius (Italy). Lazurite (Na 3Ca(AlSiO4)3(SO4,S2)) is character- ized by its dark blue color. It occurs in con- tact metamorphic rocks, usually marble. Lapis lazuli is a mixture of lazurite, calcite, and py- roxenes and these are well-known deposits in Afghanistan. Lazurite was formerly used for blue paint pigment and is a highly valued decorative stone. Zeolites are a large group of framework alumosilicates that include some 100 mineral species. The zeolites are low-temperature miner- als that form under hydrothermal conditions -- for instance, owing to alteration of nepheline in alka- line rocks or crystallization from hydrothermal solutions in cavities and amygdules of basalts.

The low-grade metamorphic conditions under which they form are known as the zeolite facies. One can easily identify zeolites in alkaline ig- neous rocks, where they form euhedral crystals, often in radiaxial and plate-like aggregates. All ze- olites are originally white in color with a vitreous luster. They have low density (about 2.1--2.2 g/cm 3) and low hardness (3.5--5). Among the zeolites, stilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite form platy crystals (Figure 29.6c) with good cleavage parallel to (010); orthorhombic natrolite is characterized by prismatic crystals with a square cross-section. Natrolite, scolecite, and mesolite occur mostly as radiaxial \ufb01brous aggregates (Figure 29.6b). For cu- bic analcime, trapezohedral crystals are typical (Figure 29.6a). Crystals of trigonal chabazite look like a cube squeezed along one of its axes (rhom- bohedron). Zeolites in sedimentary rocks, tuffs, and soils occur as \ufb01ne-grained aggregates and cannot be identi\ufb01ed in hand specimens. X-ray diffraction techniques are required instead. Ion exchange properties of some minerals Compared to the majority of minerals, zeolites have an unusual property. They are able to lose water molecules and cations from their struc- ture during heating without changing the basic framework structure, and these dried (activated) zeolites can then reabsorb water, cations, and more complicated molecules from the environ- ment. They are thus capable of ionic exchange in a more extreme way than we have described for clays. We have already described typical struc- tural features with large channels and cages through which atoms can move. In zeolites (e.g., chabazite), the diffusion is orders of magnitude faster, even at moderate temperature, than in olivine and feldspar (Table 29.2). Zeolites have been classi\ufb01ed according to their exchange properties (Table 29.3). Every zeolite has its own ion exchange capacity, but the experimental capacity is always less than its Table 29.2 Diffusion in several minerals Component Mineral T Diffusivity (\u25e6C) (cm 2/s) H2O Chabazite 45 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 H2O Chabazite 500 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Ca Chabasite 60 5.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 Ca Chabazite 500 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 H2O Ice \u22122 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 Fe\u2013Mg Olivine 1100 8.9 \u00d7 10\u221218 Fe\u2013Mg Olivine 1100 4 \u00d7 10\u221212 Fe\u2013Mg Olivine 600 8.9 \u00d7 10\u221218 O Olivine 1400 \u223c1 \u00d7 10\u221214 Si Olivine 1400 \u223c1 \u00d7 10\u221218 Na\u2013K Feldspar 900 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221213 Note: After Kretz, 1994. theoretical limit. The exchange capacity is usu- ally given in milligram equivalents/gram (where \u2018\u2018gram\u201d is 1 g of a dried zeolite powder). For ex- ample, 1 mg .equiv. of sodium is 22.99 mg, where 22.99 is the atomic weight of sodium, meaning that 22.99 mg of sodium can be adsorbed in 1 g of a dried zeolite powder. There are three main structural--chemical fac- tors for ion exchange in zeolites. The \ufb01rst is the con\ufb01guration and size of cavities (channels and cages) in their framework structures (Table 29.4). The monoclinic structures of heulandite and clinoptilolite (Figure", "page": 518}
{"text": "29.7), for example, are char- acterized by three types of open channel, de- \ufb01ned by eight- and 10-membered tetrahedral rings. These channels are oriented in three di- rections: The larger channels with 10-membered rings extend along the c-axis (A in Figure 29.7a), while eight-membered rings form both channels extending along the a-axis (C in Figure 29.7b) and channels inclined at 50 \u25e6 to the a- a x i s( Bi n Figure 29.7a). It is obvious that each type of chan- nel differs in its capacity for ionic exchange and in the speed of diffusion that can take place through it. The second factor affecting ion exchange in zeolites is the Si:Al ratio.

Among natural zeolites, mordenite (Si:Al ratio 5; exchange capacity 0.18--0.23), clinoptilolite (5; 0.19--0.25), and erionite (2.6; 0.25--0.33) are high silica zeolites, whereas phillipsite (2.5; 0.34--0.77) and chabazite (2.0; 0.34--0.71) are con- sidered low-silica zeolites. Note that the Si:Al ra- t i oi sn o ta\ufb01 x e dn u m b e rb u tv a r i e so v e rac e r t a i n range. High-silica zeolites are more stable in most environments and particularly in acid solutions. In highly concentrated acid aqueous solutions, zeolites such as clinoptilolite or mordenite can lose cations and adsorb H + or H 3O+ to form unusual substances that could be called natural solid aluminum--silica polyacids. The third factor affecting ion exchange is the location of cations in the structures of zeolites. For example, an ideal heated and dried morden- ite has a formula Ca 4Al8Si40O96. Cations (Ca 2+) occupy four positions in its structure, with three of them placed in small channels (2.9 \u02daA \u00d7 5.7 \u02daA), and one in a wider channel (6.7 \u02daA \u00d7 7.0 \u02daA). The Ca 2+ in the larger channel can be easily replaced by, for example, Sr2+,B a2+,K +,N a+, whereas the Ca2+ in the small channels can only be replaced by small cations (e.g., Na +). Heated and dried zeolite products differ in the speed at which an ionic exchange process occurs. The speed increases with the size of cages and channels, the concentration of ions in the so- lution, and the temperature. There is a wide range of uses for zeolites, both natural (from large sedimentary deposits) and synthetic, and, as a result, zeolites are among the most economically important minerals. Many of the industrial applications of zeolites have been spearheaded in the USA and Japan but they are now used worldwide. Both ion exchange and", "page": 519}

Notewor- thy is a particular utilization, descending from these properties, which uses modi\ufb01ed zeolites (i.e., subject to activating processes involving both extra-framework and framework cations) in catalytic processes in the production of lead-free high-octane gasoline. Many other applications that have been developed are based on the ability of certain zeolites to exchange large cations selec- tively from aqueous solutions; such are the most common environmentally oriented applications found in the \ufb01elds of phosphate-free detergents, wastewater treatments and agricultural uses. Radioactive 137Cs and 90Sr can be removed from low-level waste streams of nuclear installations by extracting those ions with clinoptilolite \ufb01l- ters. The same method can be used to extract am- monia and heavy metals from sewage and agri- cultural wastewaters. Zeolite \ufb01lters, particularly mordenite and clinoptilolite, are also used to re- move sulfur dioxide and other pollutants from stack gases of oil- and coal-burning power plants. Zeolite adsorption and catalytic properties can be used to enhance the oxygen content of water and air, because nitrogen is preferentially adsorbed. Zeolites are used to clean drinking water or to decrease the hardness of industrial water. The molecular sieve property of zeolites is widely applied in the petroleum industry to sep- arate organic molecules during re\ufb01nement of oil, retaining molecules larger than the width of the channel. For this application, synthetic zeolites, whose channel dimensions are tailored for par- ticular molecular sizes, are used. Natural gas is cleaned in zeolite \ufb01lters before it is transported in pipelines. Increasingly zeolites have become important in animal nutrition. Adding about 10% zeolite to the food of pigs, chickens, and ruminants results in signi\ufb01cant feed-conversion values and increased health of the animals. It", "page": 520}

There are several reasons for ion exchange phenomena in clay minerals. Broken bonds on the surfaces of clay particles enable adsorption.

Also, hydrogen atoms of OH \u2212 groups on surfaces of particles can be replaced by cations.

{"text": "Chapter 30 Metalliferous mineral deposits Introduction Applied mineralogy deals with the practical ap- plications of mineralogical knowledge, and the chapters in this section illustrate some of the main employment opportunities for mineralo- gists. Mineralogy is not merely an academic pur- suit, but is of considerable economic signi\ufb01cance. At one time mineralogy was applied largely to the \ufb01eld of mineral prospecting, but today the range of applications is much broader. Tech- nological mineralogy and mineralogical materi- als science are growing \ufb01elds, and developing needs constantly produce new branches of ap- plied mineralogy, many of them making use of sophisticated instrumentation (Chapter 12). Mineralogical expertise is, of course, indispens- able in geology and petrology. Other mineralo- gists work in gemology (see Chapter 31), in min- eral extraction technology, in chemical plants, in the cement industry (see Chapter 32), and in ceramics and the manufacturing of refrac- tory materials. Some mineralogists are also en- gaged in the fabrication of synthetic crystals, paints, enamels, and glazes, while others work in museums or become mineral dealers. Even in medicine there is a need for mineralogists. Environmental mineralogy, dealing with haz- ardous minerals, has recently become an impor- tant new application. An example is the study and remediation of asbestos contamination (see Chapter 33). Prospecting mineralogy Prospecting mineralogy deals with investigations that advance our knowledge of the occurrence of mineral deposits. Conventionally, the miner- alogical features of ores have been the primary criteria for prospecting, and much has relied on the skills and accumulated wisdom of longtime miners. For example, it has been common knowl- edge for centuries that malachite veinlets lead to copper ore; that a quartz--mica rock contain- ing columnar aggregates of topaz indicates the presence of tin and tungsten ores; that garnet-- diopside skarn relates to complex ores with lead, copper, and iron; and that quartz--microcline in- tergrowths (so-called \u2018\u2018graphic granite\u201d) are a sure sign of pegmatites. Analytical techniques provide quantitative data about ore deposits and are the basis for a better understanding of ore-forming pro- cesses. Knowledge from mineralogy is integrated with that from geochemistry, petrology, and structural geology. Prospecting mineralogy re- lies on imaginative and quantitative \ufb01eld ob- servations. Geological mapping and prospecting help to identify a mineral deposit, and then fur- ther investigations in the laboratory determine the mineralogical composition of the resources, classifying them by their geological and techno- logical varieties. The desirable and undesirable features of the material are also determined at this time. Later, the distribution of the minerals", "page": 525}

Traditionally, \ufb01eld mineralogical investiga- tions have been carried out as a part of ge- ological research and require gathering of all geological data that characterize a speci\ufb01c loca- tion. Detailed maps and sketches should docu- ment the structure, position, age, morphology, and size of a deposit. Such notes should iden- tify not only the minerals that are present, but also their relative abundance. They should also address the extent of secondary processes of metamorphism, metasomatic alteration, surface weathering, and erosion. The main mineralogical prospecting techniques rely on visual identi\ufb01ca- tion of minerals in the \ufb01eld and require sam- ple collection for later laboratory investigations.

Today traditional mineralogical prospecting in the \ufb01eld has been largely replaced by so- phisticated instrumentational methods origi- nally developed for planetary exploration. With remote-sensing techniques, potential deposits can be identi\ufb01ed using a variety of spectral signa- tures and scales. Multispectral satellite imaging measures the electromagnetic spectrum re\ufb02ected from the earth\u2019s surface in relatively broad bands with wide coverage but limited resolution. With hyperspectral imaging, often done from air- planes, a much higher resolution is achieved, although with a more limited coverage. These methods can be used to identify the spatial dis- tribution of mineral types, such as those present after clay alteration and secondary iron oxide minerals. Once a potential ore deposit has been located, systematic drill cores are taken and an- alyzed for metal content to establish the extent and commercial feasibility of the deposit. Some of the world\u2019s largest iron deposits, re- cently discovered in Brazil with advanced geo- physical techniques, would not have been found using only traditional knowledge. Similarly, some of the largest new gold deposits in the western USA are so low grade that only a few decades ago they would have gone unnoticed. Economically important minerals In the next three chapters we will discuss the eco- nomically most important minerals. Most com- monly we associate mineral resources with met- alliferous ores, and indeed the world would be very different without metals. Table 30.1 lists important minerals, their use, and their eco- nomic signi\ufb01cance. Metals are divided into fer- rous, nonferrous (base and light), and precious. Ferrous metals are used to form iron alloys, partic- ularly steel. The name base metals was given by an- cient alchemists who tried but failed to convert copper, zinc, lead, and tin to gold. The use of light metals is relatively new. They are characterized by low densities. Precious metals received their name because of their high", "page": 526}

The economic signif- icance of various metal ores is summarized in Figure 30.2. Iron is by far the most important metal, followed by aluminum, gold, and copper. As noted above, iron is the key component of steel, and the world\u2019s annual steel production (725 million tonnes) is similar in value to that of the world\u2019s annual oil production (22 billion barrels), i.e. around $US 450 billion (in 1993). In this chapter we concentrate on metallif- erous ore deposits, reviewing both their occur- rence and signi\ufb01cance. The site of a mine de- pends primarily on the geological setting, but many other factors such as ease of transporta- tion, local salaries, and political factors, includ- ing environmental laws, are becoming increas- ingly important.

Chapter 24. Some of the processes are closely related to plate tectonic activity. Along mid- oceanic ridges, seawater hydrothermal systems are formed. Continental hydrothermal activity is observed above subduction zones. Metamor- phic waters are released during high-temperature metamorphism, generally along convergent mar- gins. Even surface processes are in\ufb02uenced by plate tectonics. Placer deposits rely on mechan- ical erosion, which requires uplift. These exam- ples illustrate the importance of the tectonic evo- lution of the earth, which depends largely on changes in the rates and mechanisms for gen- eration and dissipation of its internal heat. The igneous evolution in the crust, mountain build- ing, and hydrothermal activity are all driven ul- timately by thermal convection in the mantle. However, the chemical evolution of the surface and the hydrosphere is equally important, de- pends largely on solar energy, and is in\ufb02uenced by biological activity. Both magmatic as well as surface processes can produce large deposits of metal. Sometimes the two are related, as in the case of black smokers, where metal-bearing hy- drothermal solutions interact with seawater. The wide range of geological processes that are active in the formation of mineral deposits is summa- rized in Table 30.2. Figure 30.3 shows several maps of the earth.

We are now going to explore how these tectonic units are re- lated to ore deposits (Figures 30.3b--d). Convergent margins Figure 30.3b is a world map identifying the dis- tribution of deposits of copper and molybdenum. We observe an almost perfect match with young orogenic belts and volcanic activity at continen- tal margins (Figure 30.3a). More speci\ufb01cally, the location of important mercury deposits (Figure 30.3c) is related almost exclusively to the Paleo- zoic and Cenozoic orogenic belts. During subduc- tion of oceanic crust under the continents, large volumes of sedimentary material, deposited along the continental shelf, also became sub- ducted. At greater depths, and particularly with increasing temperature, mineral reactions start to occur, beginning with clay minerals transform- ing to metamorphic silicates and releasing water. Even with the low geothermal gradients typical of subduction zones, beyond depths greater than 50 km (1.5 GPa) temperatures are reached where hydrous metamorphic minerals become unstable and dehydrate (Figure 30.4).

This ig- neous activity becomes the motor for driving hydrothermal processes. As is obvious from the isotherm in cross-section in Figure 30.4, tem- peratures to which source materials are sub- jected increase with increasing distance from the continental margin. This trend is the rea- son for the regular zonation of hydrothermal deposits in the western USA (Figure 30.5), with the lowest temperatures occurring in the Coast Ranges, where mercury deposits formed at tem- peratures below 200 \u25e6C at a shallow level. This mercury belt is followed by the gold belt in the Sierra Nevada foothills, including the Mother Lode deposit. Further west, in Nevada, silver dom- inates, followed by copper, and \ufb01nally copper-- molybdenum, with hydrothermal solutions com- ing from the greatest depth.

Divergent margins The largest extrusions of magma occur along mid-oceanic ridges. In the highly fractured ocean \ufb02oor, seawater penetrates along fractures and faults, becomes heated, and circulates towards the upwelling ridge (Figure 30.6). At temper- atures in excess of 350 \u25e6C, the hot waters react with basalt and precipitate dissolved cal- cium as epidote, titanite, and calcite, becom- ing increasingly acidic. The acidic waters dis- solve trace metals such as copper, zinc, cobalt, and manganese in basalt. The metals are then precipitated as sul\ufb01des and oxides when the hydrothermal waters come into contact with cold seawater (see also Figures 24.12 and 24.13, and corresponding discussion in Chapter 24). These deposits are called volcanogenic massive sul\ufb01des and occasionally become attached to continents -- as in Cyprus and Kuroko (Japan), where pillow lavas indicate their mid-oceanic origin. Precambrian shields While the previously discussed deposits are as- sociated with relatively recent tectonic activity and comprise the bulk of presently mined cop- per, lead, zinc, and mercury deposits, primary deposits of chromium, nickel, and platinum are old and occur mainly within Precambrian shields (Figure 30.3d). The rocks on these shields are primarily orthogneisses, derived from granodi- orites and tonalites, and ma\ufb01c to ultrama\ufb01c volcanic rocks, known as greenstone belts. The Early Precambrian greenstone belts are host to some of the richest ores of chromium, nickel, cobalt, zinc, and gold of any tectonic units. The ores are contained in ultrama\ufb01c volcanic rocks, called komatiites. Komatiites have a character- istic microstructure of intergrown crisscrossing sheathes of bladed crystals, the so-called spinifex texture, named after Australian bunchgrasses. The ultrama\ufb01c magmas formed at very high temperatures (>1500 \u25e6C), which is achieved only at great depth. Nickel sul\ufb01des form immisci- ble melts in komatiites as in the Kambalda dis- trict of Western Australia. In greenstone belts, from South Africa to Canada, and Australia, gold- bearing veins occur uniformly, particularly at the contact zone between basaltic komatiites and surrounding granitic plutons. It is from such Early Precambrian greenstone gold mineraliza- tion (around 2900 million years old) that the giant placer deposits at Witwatersrand (South Africa) were derived (2800--2500 million years ago). Layered intrusions with stratiform layers of chromite occur in some of the oldest terrestrial rocks in West Greenland (3800 million years ago), the Stillwater complex in Montana (2900 million years ago) and the mid-Tertiary Skaergaard com- plex of East Greenland. However, the largest de- posits of this type are the Great Dyke of Zim- babwe (2500 million years ago), and the Bushveld complex of South Africa (2000 million years ago). The Bushveld complex near Pretoria, South Africa, is such a huge deposit that it deserves a brief discussion. Over an area extending more than", "page": 533}

A lower zone contains alternating layers of almost pure chromite and ma\ufb01c silicate rocks. The unique \u2018\u2018critical zone\u2019\u2019 of the Meren- sky Reef also contains chromite, but in addition is very rich in native platinum. The main zone is not of great economic interest, but an up- per zone contains chromium-bearing magnetite, rich in vanadium, and is mined mainly to ex- tract that element. Only a very small portion of the deposit is presently mined. It is thought that the chromite layers do not represent immiscible melt, but rather that chromite crystals settled at the bottom of the magma chamber and episodic pulses of new magma intrusion occurred (Figure 30.7b; see alsox Figure 24.7). Sedimentary basins Without a doubt, the sedimentary iron ores known as banded iron formations are the world\u2019s most important sedimentary metal deposits, pro- viding about 60% of the world\u2019s iron ores. Algoma-type ores (named after the Algoma dis- trict in Ontario, Canada) formed when subma- rine hot springs, associated with volcanic ac- tivity, released iron-rich hydrothermal solutions into sedimentary basins (Figure 30.8). Deep ocean sediments display iron-rich layers, alternating with silica-rich layers on a scale of millime- ters to centimeters. The younger, Superior-type banded iron formations (named after Lake Supe- rior) are richer in iron, more uniformly bedded,", "page": 534}

In Superior-type iron ores, there is no as- sociation with volcanism, and the occurrence with limestone suggests deposition in shallow water. Accumulated ferrous iron in the deep ocean is the most reasonable source for the iron as well as the silica. These accumulations were transported to shallow-water coastal envi- ronments by upwelling currents. The striking proliferation of Superior-type ores about 2600-- 1800 million years ago is one of the spectac- ular geochemical anomalies of geological his- tory. In Box 30.1 we explore some aspects of the evolution of ore deposits with geological history. Box 30.1 Ore deposits and geological history As we have seen, many ore deposits correlate with major tectonic settings. Charles Meyer (1988) explored ore deposits from the perspective of history and found surprising results. Ore formation is by no means uniform, as is evident from Figure 30.9. The banded iron formations date largely to between 2800 and 1800 million years ago, with practically no younger occurrences. Porphyry coppers and tungsten skarns, on the other hand, are mostly young, between 300 million years ago and Recent. Gold placers are either very old or very young. Chromite in layered intru- sions occurs in spikes, at distant intervals. The patterns of ores over geological time seem to defy uniformitarianism. While much of the explanation for this sporadic evolution remains speculative, there is some rationale. For example, the scarcity of porphyry coppers in older rocks may be due partly to erosion of these rather shal- low deposits. However, geochemical and tectonic conditions have changed over time, as is highlighted in the discussion that follows. The proportion of ore deposits that depend on volcanic activity is greater in the Early Precambrian than in any later segment of geological time. Komatiite \ufb02ows are uniquely Early Precambrian. The high-temperature ultrama\ufb01c komatiite extrusions require partial melts with a high percentage of melt. Such melts could have occurred by means of mantle penetration on major rifts. The deposits are very large, suggesting stable conditions over long periods of time, with a rather simple overall structure, which is also supported by the widespread and homogeneous distribution of gold in various greenstone belts. At the end of the Early Precambrian there was a transition to gradual stabiliza- tion of continents, with development of large continental basins. These basins host the world\u2019s largest gold deposits in the quartz pebble conglomerate of Witwaters- rand (South Africa), as well as the banded iron formations, the world\u2019s largest iron deposits. Both of these very different", "page": 535}

{"text": "522 METALLIFEROUS MINERAL DEPOSITS iron formation coincides with the development of an oxygen-rich atmosphere and early biological life, with algal organisms producing oxygen by means of photosyn- thesis. Around 1800 million years ago the stable conditions ended, and there is geo- logical evidence for an increase in local tectonic and volcanic activity at this time. Unlike the Early Precambrian volcanism, ultrama\ufb01c lavas were absent in this period of volcanism, with andesites and rhyolites dominating instead. Some of the vol- canogenic deposits resemble porphyry coppers (Haib, Namibia), whereas others are more like mid-oceanic massive sul\ufb01des (as in Jerome, Arizona, USA). A new and very different type of deposit is seen in the clastic sediment-hosted strati- form lead\u2013zinc ores, as in Broken Hill and Mount Isa (Australia), Gamsberg (South Africa), and Grenville (New Y ork, USA). The reason for the surge in lead deposits, starting around 1750 million years ago, is not clear. It correlates with increasing oxygen levels in the atmosphere and the evolution of oceans, but why should lead, among base metals, be affected to such a large degree? There is evidence for tectonic evolution: many rocks are heavily deformed, with numerous intrusions of anorthosites, as well as alkaline rocks and carbonatites (as in Kiruna, Sweden, and Kovdor, Russia). Between 1000 and 500 million years ago, there was a period of minimum ore- forming activity, as is evident from most of the ore charts in Figure 30.9. After that period of geological time, major types of Precambrian deposits were rejuvenated in the Phanerozoic, with the notable exceptions of komatiitic nickel, anorthositic ilmenite, and banded iron. In the Paleozoic (300 million years ago) there was an- other spike of sedimentary lead\u2013zinc deposits in clastic sediments, but the increase in lead\u2013zinc deposits came mainly in carbonates at the edges of old basins (Missis- sippi Valley, USA). As we have seen earlier, Phanerozoic orogenic belts and igneous related ores of the porphyry copper type closely coincide (see Figure 30.3a,b). These younger deposits show a much greater diversity and heterogeneity than do older ones, presumably because of the much more variable crustal composition and the local reworking of old ore deposits. We can see that every geological period has some unique characteristics, and those characteristics are re\ufb02ected in the types of metal ore deposit from that pe- riod. The complicated evolution of mineral formation with time becomes plausible in the context of general geological, tectonic, magmatic, and geochemical develop- ment of the earth\u2019s crust. Since many deposits form at surface conditions or involve material that was at the surface, the importance of the geochemical evolution of the hydrosphere and atmosphere, including biological activity such as photosynthesis and sul\ufb01de oxidation, cannot be overemphasized. Obviously the geochemical laws controlling ore formation have remained the same, but the geological conditions of our planet have changed progressively, beginning with a fairly simple structure dominated by volcanic rocks (e.g., komatiites), followed by development of oceans and an atmosphere with organisms that produced oxygen through means such as photosynthesis.

Metal production around the world The distribution of metals is of considerable po- litical signi\ufb01cance, and even if recently no wars have been fought over mineral deposits (contrary t ow a r sr e l a t e dt of o s s i lf u e l s ,a si nt h eP e r - sian Gulf, the Caucasus Mountains and Caspian Sea regions), minerals have greatly in\ufb02uenced the policies of colonial powers. Gold spurred the Spanish conquest of Mexico and the Inca em- pire, valuable minerals in southern Africa (gold and diamonds in South Africa, chromite in Zim- babwe) led to British and Dutch control, and copper and cobalt deposits in Za \u00a8\u0131 r ew e r el a r g e l y responsible for Belgium\u2019s colonization of that region. South Africa, now independent like the other countries mentioned above, plays a cru- cial role in the mineral industry as it is the world\u2019s major supplier of diamonds, gold, plat- inum, chromium, manganese, and other metallic raw materials. By contrast, Russia lost its main re- gions of tantalum, gold, manganese, chromium, copper, cinnabar, uranium, tin, titanium, and zir- conium production after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In some mineral deposits only a single com- ponent is extracted (e.g., iron, chromium, man- ganese, aluminum, asbestos, graphite, sulfur, and diamond). Other deposits produce several valuable components. For example, nickel, cop- per, platinum and cobalt are extracted simul- taneously from copper--nickel sul\ufb01de deposits; muscovite, feldspar, quartz, and gemstones are obtained from pegmatites. The mines in the al- kaline rock complexes of Kovdor (Russia) produce magnetite, apatite, and baddelyite. The form in which a component occurs in a particular min- eral may also be different: in some minerals sin- gle crystals with speci\ufb01c important properties are used (muscovite, \ufb02uorite, calcite, etc.). A min- eral may be mined because it contains major el- ements in its formula (copper in chalcopyrite, iron in magnetite, potassium in sylvite), or it may have some valuable minor isomorphic substitu- tions (cadmium in sphalerite, rhenium in molyb- denite, hafnium in zircon). In order to be pro\ufb01table, a mineral must contain some component at a certain concen- tration. This concentration varies for different types of resource, from minor fractions of 1% to well over 10%. For example, in the USA (in the early 1980s) the \u2018\u2018standard\u201d (pro\ufb01table) con- tent of pure metal in ore had to exceed: 0.0005%", "page": 537}

It also varies with the type of deposit, with factors including the overall mineral composition of a processed ore, the structure and extent of an ore deposit, the presence or absence of undesirable impuri- ties, and the general accessibility of a deposit. As noted earlier, the standard contents also de- pend on local labor prices. For example, similar copper deposits may be highly pro\ufb01table in Za\u00a8\u0131re or China and worthless in France or the USA. As the mining technologies advance, lower grade de- posits can be processed. Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, the copper standard con- tent has fallen from 10% to about 0.7%. Within the past 30 years very low-grade gold ore of a standard content of only 0.00003% (or about 0.3 g/tonne) has been mined pro\ufb01tably from dissem- inated epithermal deposits in Nevada, even with a depressed price of gold. As we noted in the previous section, miner- als are unevenly distributed around the world, for geological and tectonic reasons. These geolog- ical factors combine with political and economic factors to determine the geographical distribu- tion of ore production, which is summarized in Table 30.3 Steel and ferrous metals Iron is the main metal on which our civiliza- tion relies. The beginning of the Iron Age marked a signi\ufb01cant advance over previous civilizations that relied on copper and bronze.

In magmatic iron deposits, mag- netite forms in immiscible iron oxide melts, as in rhyolites in Kiruna (Sweden), Kovdor (Russia), Mis- souri (USA), and Cerro Mercado (Mexico). While Russia, Brazil, and Australia are the main iron ore producers, Japan, Korea, Belgium, and Ger- many are the main steel manufacturers. Manganese, the most important ingredient of steel, is mined mainly from chemical sediments around the Black Sea, in northern Australia, in China, and in South Africa and as a surface alter- ation in India and Brazil. Manganese nodules on the sea \ufb02oor represent vast reserves but are not mined at present (Figure 30.10). Nickel and cobalt deposits are mainly found in laterites of ultrama\ufb01c rocks, representing mantle material that is juxtaposed with the crust. Nickel in olivine dissolves, percolates, and then precip- itates at the base of the weathered zone as gar- nierite, a complex nickel silicate mineral. Nickel- rich laterite can contain up to 3% nickel and 0.2% cobalt. The largest deposits are in New Cale- donia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and In- donesia. Nickel is also mined as pentlandite and pyrrhotite in magmatic deposits of older parts of Precambrian cratons at Sudbury (Canada), in Western Australia, and in South Africa. An impor- tant source of cobalt is linneite, which occurs in secondary copper deposits in Za \u00a8\u0131re. Chromium and vanadium are crucial compo- nents of high-performance steels, but their oc- currence is very limited, restricted primarily to stratiform deposits in layered ma\ufb01c rocks such as the Bushveld complex (South Africa) and the Great Dyke (Zimbabwe) (Figure 30.3d). There are some lenticular deposits in ma\ufb01c and ultrama\ufb01c igneous rocks at the base of the oceanic crust at convergent plate margins in Kazakhstan, Cuba, Turkey, and Albania. Southern Africa and Kaza- khstan account for over 70% of the world\u2019s chromium production.

Shading indicates the extent of laterites. Molybdenum occurs in molybdenite in por- phyry copper. About 5--10% of mined molybde- num is used in the manufacturing of corrosion- resistant steel tools, 30% of its consumption is in chemicals such as orange pigments, and the re- mainder is used as lubricants and as a catalyst in oil re\ufb01ning. Tungsten is added to steel for high-temperature and high-strength applications. Tungsten carbide is one of the hardest materials and has only re- cently been replaced for some applications by new materials such as synthetic diamonds, BN, and TiC (or coatings of these materials) to im- prove the durability of tools. Tungsten wires are used as \ufb01laments in light bulbs. Tungsten occurs in the minerals scheelite and wolframite, which form in skarns. Worldwide, China dominates the tungsten market. The Shizhuyan mine in Hunan Province is the largest producer in the world. Light metals Light metals are increasingly replacing both steel for structural applications and copper for trans- mission of electricity. These metals are strong, but they have the advantage of a much lower density than iron and copper (1.7 for magne- sium, 2.7 for aluminum, and 4.5 for titanium, as compared to 7.9 for iron and 9.0 for copper). A disadvantage of aluminum, however, is its lower melting point (650 \u25e6C versus 1535 \u25e6C for iron). By means of alloying, the strength of aluminum can be improved at least at moderate temperatures. For high-temperature applications, titanium has received much interest because of its relatively low density and its much higher melting point (1678 \u25e6C) than aluminum. Over 30% of modern aircraft are now composed of titanium. Aluminum is extracted from bauxite, an aluminum-rich laterite composed of a mixture of gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore. It forms by intense weathering of felsic igneous rocks and shales in a climatic environment of high rain- fall and high temperature and extended geolog- ical stability because the weathering processes are very slow. The distribution of present-day la- terites is superposed on the world map in Fig- ure 30.11, and indeed the world\u2019s largest bauxite mines (northern Australia, Guinea, Jamaica, and Brazil) are all observed to be in lateritic regions. Aluminum is also extracted from nepheline in nepheline syneites (Khibini, Kola Peninsula, Russia) and alunite in altered volcanic rocks (Zardalek, Azerbaidjan).", "page": 540}
{"text": "METAL PRODUCTION AROUND THE WORLD 527 Aluminum production requires high energy: \ufb01rst heat is required to produce alumina (Al 2O3) from aluminum hydroxides, and then alumina reduction to aluminum requires considerable amounts of electricity. Thus, similar to iron, min- ing of the raw material does not occur at the same locations as the metal production. Alu- minum is processed in countries with large hy- droelectric power plants, such as Canada, New Zealand, and Brazil. Because of the high pro- duction cost, a signi\ufb01cant amount of aluminum metal is recycled. Titanium is mined as ilmenite and rutile. Ti- tanium is used as a metal (5%), but by far its most important application (95%) is as a white paint pigment. It occurs in ma\ufb01c intrusive rocks, particularly at the margins of anorthosites. Min- ing from these primary rocks is expensive (mines are in Australia, Norway, and Canada). Both il- menite and rutile are hard refractory minerals and therefore accumulate as placers. About half of the world\u2019s production is from such deposits, which are found in uplifted beach dunes and beach sands in Florida (USA), on the Natal coast of South Africa, and in Queensland (Australia). These deposits are rapidly becoming exhausted. Beryllium is mainly mined from beryl and be- trandite in pegmatites. The Spor Mountain mine in Utah (USA) is presently the largest source. Beryllium is very light (density 1.85 g/cm 3) and used mainly in alloys with copper. Base metals Copper appears to have been the \ufb01rst metal used by humans in the preparation of tools, the most likely reason being that copper occurs in metal- lic form at the earth\u2019s surface. A copper axe was found along with the frozen remains of an Ice Age man (Oetzi) recently discovered in northern Italy and dated to 3200 BC, and we know that copper was being smelted in the Middle East by 4000 BC. Where tin was available, as in Corn- wall, copper was alloyed with the tin to pro- duce the harder alloy bronze, which initiated the Bronze Age. During the Roman Empire, zinc was alloyed with copper to produce brass. Today cop- per is used mainly because of its high electrical and thermal conductivity. The USA, Chile, and Canada are the major copper exporters. Copper occurs in many minerals, but chal- copyrite (CuFeS 2) is by far the most common and is found in hydrothermal deposits, the so- called porphyry copper deposits (see Figure 30.3b). As was noted in Chapter 24, these hydrothermal deposits formed around felsic intrusions that fed volcanoes, although the volcanoes are now largely eroded. Hydrothermal minerals crystal- lized in veins when magmatic waters were ex- pelled along fractures. The largest deposits are found on convergent continental margins along the Paci\ufb01c Rim in western Canada, the western USA, Mexico, Chile, and New Guinea/Philippines. Other hydrothermal copper deposits (the vol- canogenic massive sul\ufb01des) formed as sediments where hydrothermal systems vented onto the sea\ufb02oor along mid-oceanic ridges. Such deposits crop out on the island of Cyprus (named after /H9260\u00b4/H9271/H9266/H9267/H9265\u03c2the", "page": 541}
{"text": "Greek word for copper), in Rio Tinto in Spain, and in Kuroko in Japan. Copper sul\ufb01de minerals are not stable at surface conditions and dissolve during weathering, producing secondary copper deposits. Lead and zinc often occur together, in galena and sphalerite, respectively. Like chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite occur almost exclusively in hydrothermal deposits, most of which are found along the western margins of the North and South American continents in Canada, Mexico, and Peru, and in northern Australia (Mount Isa). Tin is the only major metal undergoing a strongly declining market, tin prices being presently depressed. The most important tin min- eral is cassiterite, which has ore deposits in only a few parts of the world. Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and southern China are the princi- pal regions. We discussed cassiterite formation, which occurs as high-temperature hydrothermal alteration in the roof of granitic intrusions, pro- ducing rocks known as greisen (see Chapter 16). Cassiterite is highly resistant to erosion and accu- mulates in placer deposits. Most of the tin min- ing in Malaysia and Thailand relies on placers. Mercury and red cinnabar were used by an- cient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans in cosmetic applications and as medicine. Indeed, the mines at Monte Amiata (Italy) and Idrija (Slovenia) can be traced back to Roman times. In the sixteenth century the amalgamation method was invented", "page": 541}

This discovery resulted in a large demand for mercury and the Almaden mine in Spain became a major supplier. It still is the largest mercury mine in the world. In water, mercury can form the highly toxic compound methyl mercury. Because it is a potential health hazard, the use of mercury has been sharply reduced but it is still an important component of ammunition.

Most mercury deposits formed at temperatures lower than 200 \u25e6C. The distribution coincides with shallow subduction zones (see Figure 30.3c). Arsenic and mercury are found in similar en- vironments. Arsenic occurs in arsenopyrite, enar- gite, and tennantite, but is produced mainly from realgar and orpiment, in low-temperature hy- drothermal ore deposits. It is used as a wood preservative, herbicide, and insecticide because of its toxic properties. Precious metals Gold has been valued for its rich color and unique luster since ancient times and has long been used to make jewelry. Because gold is rare, it is very valuable. Throughout history, only about 110 000 tonnes of gold have been mined (less than a cube that is 20 m on each side), and most amazingly, about 80% of this total is preserved, almost half of it owned by central banks. Of today\u2019s production of approximately 2000 tonnes per year, more than 80% is used for jewelry, with about another 5% consumed by the electronics industry, where it is valued because of its extremely high conductivity and resistance to corrosion. Gold occurs mainly in its native state or is alloyed with silver in electrum or, some- times, with tellurium in tellurides. Primary de- posits are hydrothermal (Figure 30.12). Epither- mal gold deposits (<250 \u25e6C) are associated with felsic volcanism (e.g., the historic mines of Com- stock in Nevada and Cripple Creek in Colorado (USA)). Silver is often the dominant economic el- ement. Mesothermal deposits (>250 \u25e6C) consist of gold-bearing quartz veins at deeper crustal levels. The veins are usually surrounded by cal- cite and other carbonates, suggesting that the hydrothermal solutions were rich in CO 2. Good", "page": 542}
{"text": "RESERVES 529 examples in the USA are the Mother Lode dis- trict in California and the Homestake deposit in South Dakota. The Witwatersrand district in South Africa is a late Early Precambrian paleoplacer deposit. This deposit is so much larger than all the other gold deposits in the world that it dominates global production and reserves. To put things into perspective, the Witwatersrand has yielded about 32 000 tonnes and contains a reserve of 20 000 tonnes of gold, compared to 2000 tonnes recovered from the large California placer de- posits, mainly during the Gold Rush years of the mid-nineteenth century. Presently South Africa produces about 600 tonnes per year, and North America (USA and Canada) about the same. Pro- duction in the USA and Canada has increased sharply during the past 20 years because new technologies have become available for extract- ing gold from very low-grade ores. The principal use of silver has traditionally been in jewelry and tableware, but increasingly industrial applications are becoming important. Like gold, it is used in the electronics industries. An important application is photographic \ufb01lm, making use of a light-sensitive reaction that re- duces silver halide compounds to silver. Silver oc- curs in epithermal veins, forming as hot mag- matic waters from deeper levels cool to 100 \u25e6C to precipitate silver. The largest deposits are in Australia (Broken Hill, Mount Isa), USA (Bingham, Utah), Mexico, and Peru. Platinum production has increased dramati- cally over the past 50 years, while gold and sil- ver production have remained relatively stable. The main market for platinum group elements (platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, irid- ium, osmium) is in the chemical industry, where it serves as a catalyst, much of it for catalytic converters in automobile exhaust systems. These devices speed oxidation reactions that convert hy- drocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxides to carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water. However, even with all these industrial applications, plat- inum production is only a small fraction of that of gold. We have already discussed the occurrence of platinum in layered ultrama\ufb01c intrusions such as the Bushveld (Merensky Reef ) and Great Dyke 107 106 105 104 103 102 101 100 10\u20131 10\u20132 10\u20133 102 104 106 108 1010 1012 1014 Consumption (kg) Price (dollars/kg) Gem diamond Ruby Emerald Sapphire Au Industrial diamond Ag Ni Cu Al Steel Cement Sand and gravel Pb Potash Co Hg W Mn Rutile PhosphateGypsum Crushed stone V Fig. 30.13 The consumption versus price plot of a wide range of materials illustrates a very clear inverse relationship.

Less important are magmatic sul\ufb01des such as those at Sudbury in Canada. Reserves The economy of a mineral resource depends on a variety of factors.

It is not easy to give sensible es- timates for reserves. A geological determination of a metal reserve may rely on extrapolating the average crustal abundance of an element. By de- termining abundances for well-studied localities, we can statistically infer the abundance for the earth, or at least for continental regions on the earth. Another estimate is obtained by means of a detailed geological analysis of typical set- tings, and then extrapolating this analysis to re- gions with similar tectonic features but where no detailed prospecting work has been undertaken. There is quite a good correlation between geolog- ical reserve estimates and crustal abundance of metals (Figure 30.14).", "page": 543}

One fundamental problem in formulating these estimates is the de\ufb01nition of a \u2018\u2018reserve\u2019\u2019 it- self. Take, for example, iron. Most rock-forming minerals contain iron in substantial amounts, and iron reserves interpreted in this context are practically in\ufb01nite. However, there is no eco- nomic way to extract iron from silicates or, as we have seen earlier, from sul\ufb01des. Up to what minimum grade do we count the presence of a mineral as a potential reserve? Magnetite occurs in many plutonic and metamorphic rocks, but beyond a certain grade magnetite extraction is simply not feasible. In addition, the grade limit changes with time. As new technologies become available, lower grade ores can be processed and thus reserves will increase accordingly. This lower limit, however, is also in\ufb02uenced by demand and price. Large deposits of low-grade ore are avail- able and therefore of great economic interest. It is often more useful to develop new extraction techniques and process large low-grade deposits, rather than prospect for small deposits of high- grade ores. Demand for mineral resources is not easy to predict. For example, owing to negative public opinion, very few nuclear power plants have been built in recent years, leading to a drop in the con- sumption and price of uranium. Iron as a struc- tural material has been losing ground to concrete and plastics. Copper wires are being replaced by aluminum and \ufb01berglass equivalents.

There has been much research into estimating reserves of oil and natural gas be- cause these energy resources affect us directly in our daily life, but similar estimates also exist for minerals (Figure 30.15).

{"text": "Chapter 31 Gemstones Introduction The \ufb01rst mineral you ever examined conscien- tiously was probably a gemstone, and gems are the objects that most people associate directly with minerals. Note that in many cases the names used for gems are different from those of the regular minerals that they represent. For ex- ample, ruby and sapphire are varieties of corun- dum, emerald and aquamarine are varieties of beryl, and alexandrite is a variety of chrysoberyl. In addition, the weight units used in gemology are different from those used in ordinary science. The most common weight unit is the carat, which corresponds to 0.2 g. Table 31.1 lists some of the important minerals that are used as gemstones. Gemstones have been de\ufb01ned as minerals that are highly valued for their beauty, durability, and rarity; they may be worn for adornment or used to decorate art objects. Since they are rare, they have a high value. In fact the values of diamond, alexandrite, ruby, and emerald, the most pre- cious gemstones, all exceed the value of gold (by weight unit) by a factor of about 3000 (Table 31.2). Today many gems can be produced industri- ally, with properties similar to those of their nat- ural counterparts. These arti\ufb01cial gems, however, sell at only a fraction of the price of the equiva- lent natural stones. Nevertheless, gem synthesis is a huge industry, both for jewelry manufactur- ing and industrial applications. Many gems are literally permanent and do not degrade in the atmosphere, in water, or by abrasion (although not all gems have the high hardness of diamond or corundum). Therefore, gems have been seen as a good investment for very many generations. However, a cautionary note should be offered: some colored gems (such as amethyst, rose quartz, and yellow topaz) lose their coloring during prolonged exposure to sun- light. As another example, opal loses its high wa- ter content when moderately heated, and this de- hydration destroys the opal\u2019s color pattern. The worldwide production of gems is small. The yearly consumption of gem diamond, ruby, sapphire, and emerald amounts to only about 10 000 kg. However, their value is about the same as the yearly production of cement. De Beers, by far the largest diamond company, sold over \ufb01ve billion US dollars of raw diamonds in 2000, about half of it in the USA. This number is of consid- erable economic signi\ufb01cance, particularly when one considers that cutting diamonds and setting them in jewelry increases their value about 10- fold. The visual appeal of different gemstones varies greatly. The majority are highly transpar- ent to light; others, such as moonstone, opal, or tiger\u2019s eye, are translucent; and a few, such as lapis lazuli, are opaque to light. Most gemstones are colored, and the color gives gems such as ruby, sapphire, emerald, and opal their visual appeal. Diamond is generally a colorless gem- stone, and the attractiveness of a particular di- amond depends on the interaction of white light with the crystal by internal re\ufb02ection", "page": 546}

The simplest cut is a cabochon with either one \ufb02at surface (Fig- ure 31.1a) or two spherical surfaces (Figure 31.1b). More sophisticated are faceted cuts with smooth planar surfaces. A classical cut, particularly for diamonds, is the \u2018\u2018brilliant cut\u2019\u2019 with 58 facets. It is prepared from the frequently octahedral raw diamond (Figure 31.2a) by cutting off one corner (Figure 31.2b), polishing it to a conical shape (Fig- ure 31.2c), and \ufb01nally grinding the facets (Figure 31.2d). A brilliant cut consists of an upper part called the crown, topped by a table, and a lower part called the pavillion, with a small facet called the culet at the bottom, parallel to the table. The reason for such a complicated cut is to optimize the re\ufb02ection of light in the crystal. \u2018\u2018Brilliance\u2019\u2019 depends on the ability of a crystal to re\ufb02ect the light to the eye.

Gemstones have been used since the dawn of history, and there are even examples from pre- historic times. In Bronze Age graves from Bo- hemia, pierced garnets were found that could be strung together to form a necklace. Early on, at- tractive stones were not valued merely for their beauty and used in jewelry; because of their rar- ity, they were made a part of local mythology and even had supernatural powers attributed to them. Some of these myths still persist today. As early as 5000 BC Assyrians and Hittites were using amulets made of hematite, lapis lazuli, amazonite, clear quartz, and chalcedony as tal- ismans. In Egypt, the amulet took the form of the scarab beetle, with those made of emerald, ruby, amethyst, and turquoise being among the more precious. Around 2000 BC stone beads were better rounded and polished and combined with gold to create sophisticated jewelry. Very early on, a gem trade became estab- lished, with routes from Egypt to central Asia. Egyptians mined turquoise in the Sinai Desert and imported emerald and lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. At Gjebel Sikait between the Nile and the Red Sea are emerald mines that were worked in a systematic way at least 4000 years ago. The production reached a peak during the Roman occupation of Egypt, and sporadic mining in the so-called Cleopatra mines lasted until AD 1750. These gem mines are the oldest known. Independently of the ancient Old World cul- tures, gemstones were used in the pre-Columbian American civilizations. Incan and Mayan cultures used emerald abundantly, and it is now estab- lished that Mexican emeralds were traded from mines in Colombia. The famous Muzo mine in Colombia has supplied emeralds for over 1000 years and is still one of the main producers of stones of unequalled quality (Plate 15d). As far as we know diamonds were \ufb01rst found in central India near the town of Golconda, whose name means \u2018\u2018opulent wealth\u2019\u2019. In ancient epics they play an important role in the Hindu religion, and it was from India that diamonds were \ufb01rst introduced to Europe. One of the most famous, though not of the largest, diamonds is known as the Koh-i-Noor, originally a 186 carat stone that is now part of the British Crown jewels (Box 31.1).

{"text": "536 GEMSTONES Box 31.1 Some famous Indian diamonds The 186 carat Koh-i-Noor (mountain of light) was \ufb01rst described in the fourteenth century in central India in the family of the Rajah of Malwa, but tradition suggests that it was found thousands of years ago and was worn by heroes of the celebrated Hindu epic Mahabharata. It changed hands many times through conquests, was owned by the Mughal Emperors in India, and came into the possession of Nadir, Shah of Persia, after the conquest of India in 1739. It was later returned to India, and with the annexation of India by the British Government in 1849, the Koh-i- Noor was given to Queen Victoria, who had it recut to 109 carats. Unfortunately, the recutting diminished its historic value. There are two other large diamonds from India that still have the traditional cutting: the Orloff, now in Russia, and the Great Mogul, at originally 793 carats the largest known Indian diamond, which was described by the French traveler Jean Baptiste Tavernier in 1665 but has since disappeared. Some sources claim that it may be the same stone as the Koh-i-Noor before it was cut. More recent history surrounds the Regent (410 carats), which was found in 1701 near Golconda by an Indian slave. It was bought by Sir Thomas Pitt, then Governor of Madras and later Prime Minister of Britain. He sold it in 1717 to the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France, who became King Louis XV. The stone was used both in the King\u2019s crown and in the hat of Queen Marie Antoinette. After the French Revolution the Regent jewel, together with other diamonds, was stolen but later found. At one point it decorated the hilt of Napoleon\u2019s sword, but after Napoleon went into exile, his second wife, Marie Louise, gave it to her father, the Emperor of Austria. He returned it to France, and the Regent is presently on exhibit in the Louvre in Paris. a grain mount to determine the refractive in- dex with the immersion method. Gemologists use energy-dispersive X-ray \ufb02uorescence (EDXRF) on gem surfaces with a scanning electron mi- croscope (see Chapter 12) and occasionally pow- der XRD on minute amounts of material scraped from surfaces. The most important instrument for gem identi\ufb01cation is a binocular gemologi- cal microscope (10\u00d7 to 60\u00d7 magni\ufb01cation, with dark\ufb01eld and bright\ufb01eld illumination), used in re\ufb02ected mode. It serves to check inclusions and growth features, and for evidence of treatment and synthesis. In addition, three modi\ufb01ed instru- ments are particularly important for gem analy- sis: a refractometer to determine the refractive index on a planar surface, a spectroscope to de- termine absorption spectra, and a polariscope to explore birefringence. Ag e mrefractometer is similar to the Abbe re- fractometer described in Chapter 9 (see Figure 9.6), which is used to determine the refractive index of liquids. The refractometer makes use of the critical angle of total re\ufb02ection. A face of the gem is mounted on a glass half-cylinder with an oil", "page": 550}

The border between the two illuminated \ufb01elds de\ufb01nes the critical angle and thus the re- fractive index of the crystal. In a gem refractome- ter a scale calibrated in refractive index units is superposed on the illuminated image and the re- fractive index is easily determined (e.g., 1.62 in Figure 31.4b). The refractive index of the glass cylinder (usually 1.90) sets an absolute upper limit for refractive index determination. If the refractive index of the oil is lower than that of the crystal, total re\ufb02ection occurs on the oil rather than the crystal. Because of dispersion, refractive indices vary with wavelength. In this case the boundary on the scale is not sharp, but consists of a band displaying spectral colors. The edges of the band (Figure 31.4c) can be used to determine refractive indices for red (e.g., 1.628) and violet (1.640), the difference between the two being the dispersion (0.012). If crystals are birefringent, two shadow edges are observed on the scale (Figure 31.4d). Ag e mspectroscope analyzes the absorption of light by the crystal. As white light travels through a colored crystal, one or more wavelengths are selectively absorbed. A gem is mounted on a black background and illuminated with a bright white light source.

Care needs to be taken that only light that has passed through the crystal enters the spectro- scope. The white light produces a rainbow spec- trum. The absorption spectrum displays dark bands superposed on the rainbow spectrum, and these bands are diagnostic of the coloring agent. There are broad absorption bands (such as be- tween 520 and 640 nm in ruby (Plate 1b)), and sharp bands (e.g., at 490 nm in peridote, a gem variety of olivine (Plate 1c)). The cause of these absorption bands was discussed in Chapter 11. Note that in many gems, color is due to chro- matophore trace elements such as chromium, iron, and manganese. In others, particularly di- amonds, the absorption spectrum is caused by defects in the crystal structure (color centers). A polariscope is a simple version of a petro- graphic microscope, consisting of two polarizing plates with polarization directions at right an- gles (crossed polarizers) without an optical lens system. The crystal is held with tweezers between the two polarizers, with a light source under- neath. With this instrument one can immedi- ately distinguish colored glass beads from gems such as ruby or amethyst. Inclusions are often in good contrast. Important gems The most important and precious gemstones are diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire, but there are numerous others, some of which are listed in Table 31.1. We brie\ufb02y review here some charac- teristics of these minerals, discussing both their occurrence and signi\ufb01cance. Gem-quality miner- als form in only a few primary environments. Di- amonds, for example, form in the upper man- tle and are brought up to the surface in kim- berlite pipes. Ruby and sapphire grow in high- temperature environments, both in alkaline mag- mas and in aluminous metamorphic rocks. Emer- ald is mainly a product of hydrothermal systems. Many other gemstones, including aquamarine, topaz, and tourmaline, are found in pegmatites. Many commercial gem deposits are secondary and are mined in ancient and recent alluvial for- mations known as placers. Placers form as a re- sult of water action with gradients in velocity. Where velocities are highest, lighter minerals are swept away while heavier ones collect in depres- sions. An extreme case of contrasting densities exists between precious metals such as gold and rock-forming minerals. The density of diamond, ruby, and sapphire is also higher than that of quartz, feldspar, and mica (around 4 versus 2.6-- 2.8 g/cm 3), though the contrast is much less pro- nounced. Another factor that contributes to the conservation of gems in placers is extreme hard- ness and chemical inertness, preventing mechan- ical abrasion and weathering. While most other minerals quickly degrade to \ufb01ne sand, diamond, ruby, and sapphire resist breakdown and are pre- served as large crystals. The alluvial action pro- vides a selection in quality.

Diamond We saw in Chapter 20 that most diamonds formed originally in the mantle at depths of up to 750 km (corresponding to a pressure of 35 GPa) and at temperatures of 2000 \u25e6C or more. From the original source they were brought up to the sur- face at great velocity and driven by expanding volatile gases. This transport took place in pipes, inclusions in ultrama\ufb01c rocks called kimberlite. Kimberlite pipes are carrot shaped, probably ex- isting as narrow dikes at depth and expanding to a conical shape near the top (see Figure 20.8). Dia- monds exist only in very small concentrations in kimberlites. South African kimberlites yield only about 0.1 carats (0.02 g) per tonne. Kimberlites in the Argyle region of Western Australia yield up to 5 carats per tonne, although these diamonds are of lesser quality than those from Africa. Dia- monds recently discovered in high-pressure meta- morphic rocks are of no economic importance. We have previously noted that all early diamonds used as gemstones originated from India. By the \ufb01fteenth century, Indian diamonds had become \ufb01rmly established in Europe. With demand increasing, the Indian sources became depleted and exploration started in other parts of the world. In 1725 diamonds were discovered in Brazil. Like the Indian diamonds, they occur as placer deposits in gravels and conglomerates. In 1867 the \ufb01rst diamond was found in South Africa near the town of Kimberley, and that country has since then become the world\u2019s largest pro- ducer of gem-quality diamond. Other diamond deposits have become important and are mined from kimberlites and related lamproites, all located in very old continental shields in Yakutia (Siberia, Russia), Za \u00a8\u0131re, Botswana, Sierra Leone, Argyle (Western Australia), and the Northwestern Territories of Canada (Figure 31.6). Large placer mining operations are found in Namibia, Angola, Sierra Leone, Brazil (Diamantina), and Venezuela. Presently Australia and Za \u00a8\u0131re produce a larger proportion of diamonds than does South Africa, although most of these are industrial grade. Presently considerable diamond exploration is conducted in Canada. The largest diamond ever recovered is the great Cullinan, originally at 3026 carats. It was", "page": 553}

Later it was cut into over 100 polished stones, including the Greater Star of Africa (530 carats) and the Lesser Star of Africa (317 carats), which are the world\u2019s largest cut diamonds and belong to the British Crown. Other famous dia- monds are listed in Table 31.3. Emerald Emerald is the dark-green variety of beryl. The color is due to traces of Cr 3+ or V 4+, substitut- ing for Al 3+ in the crystal structure. Like ordi- nary beryl, most emerald deposits are in peg- matites and hydrothermal veins. However, these dikes and veins are associated with granitic intru- sions into ultrama\ufb01c rocks where the chromium and vanadium are found. The most important modern emerald deposits are in Colombia: its fa- mous deposits at Muzo and Chivor, which supply emeralds of the highest quality, are hydrother- mal. As we discussed in Chapter 24, at elevated temperatures and pressures, water is capable of dissolving large amounts of elements. In Colom- bia hydrothermal calcite veins contain emerald. The host rock in which the hydrothermal veins occur is a chromium-bearing carbonaceous shale, which makes it relatively easy to extract the gem- stones. In addition to clear crystals of emerald, there is another form of emerald that displays a star pattern, called trapiche (Plate 15d). Other emerald deposits occur in metamor- phic rocks, such as biotite schists near Ekaterin- burg in the Ural Mountains (Russia), Habachtal (Austria), and Lake Manyara (Tanzania). During the seventeenth century, large Colombian emer- alds were sought by the Mughal nobility of India, and some exceptional pieces are preserved. Most famous is the 218-carat Mogul (not to be mis- taken for the Great Mogul diamond, mentioned earlier), inscribed with Islamic prayers and dated 1695. After the conquest of India by the Persians in 1739, many Colombian emeralds in India be- came part of the crown jewels of Iran, which still has the largest collection of emeralds in the world. Another exquisite collection is in the Top- kapi museum in Istanbul (Turkey).", "page": 554}
{"text": "IMPORTANT GEMS 541 Because of the high value of emerald when cut for jewelry, only a few natural emerald crystals have survived. The largest known crystal is the 7025 carat Emilia crystal discovered in 1969 and owned by a private mining company. A su- perb 1759 carat crystal is in the collection of the Banco de la Republica in Bogot \u00b4a, Colombia, and an 858 carat crystal is part of the Smithsonian Institution collection (Washington, DC, USA). All these crystals have the typical beryl morphol- ogy, with a hexagonal prism topped by a basal plane. Ruby and sapphire Ruby and sapphire are varieties of the mineral corundum. The red color of ruby originates from Cr 3+,a n dt h eb l u eo fs a p p h i r ei sd u et oF e2+\u2212 Ti4+ charge transfer (see Chapter 11). Ruby and sapphire deposits are often closely associated, al- though one variety usually dominates. Ruby never occurs as crystals of a size com- parable to that of large diamonds and emeralds. Because of its rare natural occurrence and attrac- tive properties such as brilliance in color and high hardness, ruby became the \ufb01rst candidate for modern gem synthesis. The highest quality ruby, with intense brilliance, is from limestone in Mogok, Myanmar; dark purple crystals are mined in Thailand. Ruby and sapphire form mainly in high- temperature metamorphic environments as a re- sult of recrystallization from material rich in aluminum and poor in silicon and magnesium. These geochemical conditions are essential, be- cause otherwise sillimanite and spinel would form. The Mogok deposit occurs in a low-pressure setting, with shallow granitic intrusions. Ruby occurs in calcite marbles, interbedded in pelitic schists and gneisses. Associated minerals are gar- net, graphite, and diopside. Where the marble is dolomitic, forsterite and spinel crystallize, also with gem-quality crystals. Sapphires from Myan- mar are valued for their dark indigo-blue color. Gem corundum occurs in a different envi- ronment in Thailand. In Chanthabury, ruby and sapphire are found in weathered alkali basalt. However, the minerals did not crystallize in this basaltic magma but were simply transported in it to the surface, together with gem-quality olivine (peridote) in xenoliths. In Myanmar and Thailand, ruby and sapphire are rarely found in fresh source rocks, and there- fore the mineralogical conditions of formation are not very clear. The two gems are generally mined in highly weathered rocks and derived soils, as well as in associated alluvial placers. This is also true for the other economically important gem-quality corundum deposits in Sri Lanka. The hexagonal star pattern, occasionally observed in sapphire from Sri Lanka (Plate 13d), is attributed to oriented submicroscopic inclusions of rutile (see Figure 11.9a). Aquamarine, tourmaline, chrysoberyl, and topaz While all the four major gemstones occur in very special geological settings, the largest va- riety of gem minerals (aquamarine, tourmaline, chrysoberyl, topaz, and others) are found in pegmatites. As discussed in Chapter 19, most pegmatites are of granitic composition and con- tain quartz, alkali feldspar, and sodic", "page": 555}
{"text": "plagioclase as the principal minerals. Pegmatites form dur- ing the \ufb01nal stages of igneous activity, when most of the magma has crystallized except for a quartzo-feldspathic part. This uncrystallized re- mainder is enriched in volatiles and rises, in- jecting itself along fractures into pre-existing rocks. Pegmatites are enriched in noncompati- ble elements, i.e., elements that do not \ufb01t into the crystal structures of common rock-forming minerals. Such elements are beryllium, lithium, cesium, boron, manganese, phosphorus, and \ufb02uo- rine. Minerals containing these elements include tourmaline, beryl, chrysoberyl, kunzite (gem spo- dumene), and topaz. When pegmatites crystal- lize, large crystals form, with spodumene and beryl crystals measuring up to 20 m in length. Pegmatites that contain gem-quality crystals of rare minerals generally crystallize at shallow depth. Classic pegmatites that have been stud- ied in great detail are those of Pala (in San Diego County, California, USA), the Black Hills (South Dakota, USA), Harding (New Mexico, USA) and the Ural Mountains (Russia), but by far the most famous gem pegmatites occur in Minas Gerais, Brazil.

The best-known mine lo- cations are Cruzeiro (green and pink tourmaline), Golconda (green and bicolored tourmaline), and Virgem da Lapa (aquamarine, tourmaline, and blue topaz). Mines at these localities not only pro- duce large quantities of samples for the interna- tional gem trade but also provide crystals that are on display in most major mineral museums around the world. Gemstone enhancements The principal use of gems is as adornments in jewelry. Therefore, great efforts are made not only to \ufb01nd attractive stones but also to improve their appearance. One way is to cut a natural crystal into a stone with either regular facets or smooth curved surfaces as in a cabochon. Since Egyptian times, much effort has also been spent on enhancing or altering natural colors and sur- face irregularities. Today gemstone enhancement is a big issue for the jewelry industry. For ex- ample, a truly blue natural aquamarine is very rare and expensive, but by simple heat treat- ment, a greenish-blue color in aquamarine can be changed to pure blue. Low-quality brownish color amethyst can be heat treated to citrine and is the most common source of this gem variety. Often these changes are dif\ufb01cult to detect, particularly when one is using destruction-free methods. In this section we discuss brie\ufb02y some of the meth- ods used to improve the appearance of various t y p e so fg e m s t o n e . Obvious gem defects that are easy to detect are fractures reaching the surface and produc- ing unwanted re\ufb02ection of light. Gem dealers use various methods to \ufb01ll open fractures with materials that have a refractive index close to that of the crystal, which makes the fractures less noticeable. A traditional way has been to treat crystals with oils or natural resins such as Canada balsam. One problem with these me- dia is that they wear off with time and are sen- sitive to heat, solvents, and detergents, obviat- ing the desired durability property of a gem. On the other hand, an advantage of these natural oils is that they are relatively easy to remove or replace. More recently, synthetic resins re- lated to epoxy have been applied; these are much more permanent and cannot be removed without destroying the gemstone. These fracture treat- ments can sometimes be detected by observing a gem under polarized light or by its ultraviolet \ufb02uorescence. Dying is an enhancement technique that has been used for thousands of years. As an example, a beryl with microfractures can be treated with a dark green resin to make it super\ufb01cially resem- ble emerald. Obviously such dyes penetrate only the surface and are not very stable. Ruby dealers in Thailand treat almost all rough rubies with red \u2018\u2018ruby oil\u2019\u2019 before selling them. There are also more permanent ways to change color, and many of these methods relate to the physical origin of color", "page": 556}
{"text": "in crystals (see Chapter 11). Heating can produce severe and permanent color changes. For example, brown, chromium- bearing topaz becomes pink at a temperature as low as 450--500 \u25e6C. Milky titanium-bearing corun- dum becomes blue when heated close to the melting point (2050 \u25e6C). In fact, a vast majority of blue sapphires in the jewelry trade today have been subjected to one or more high-temperature heat treatments. Such heat treatments may pro- duce damage, such as fractures around inclu- sions or oxidation of included iron minerals, and therefore can be sometimes detected. Heating in- tensi\ufb01es the blue color of corundum. Heating of amethyst at low temperature can both reverse any radiation-induced damage that produced color centers and remove some of the darker smoky components from the spectrum. Heating at higher temperature produces yellow quartz that looks very similar to citrine. Almost all \u2018\u2018citrine\u2019\u2019 on the market is heated amethyst. It can sometimes be distinguished from natural citrine by the presence of Dauphin \u00b4e twinning, which is rare in true citrine. Heating is often applied to topaz. Brown topaz of low value owes its color to a combination of a chromium-produced pink component and a color-center-produced yellow component. Heat- ing removes the color center defects and leaves only the pink color. There are numerous other applications of heating.", "page": 556}
{"text": "CRYSTAL SYNTHESIS 543 We have seen in Chapter 11 that ionizing ra- diation often produces color centers and that such radiation is responsible for the brown color of smoky quartz, the blue color of halite, and the purple color of amethyst. With arti\ufb01cial ir- radiation a whole range of color effects can be produced. This radiation may be in the form of alpha particles (helium nuclei), beta particles (ac- celerated electrons), \u03b3-rays, or neutrons. There are basically three methods that are employed by the gem industry: \u03b3-ray facilities, generally using ra- dioactive 60Co as a source; linear accelerators pro- ducing high-energy electrons; and nuclear reac- tors producing neutrons. Neutron and electron irradiation are the pre- ferred techniques to induce color in diamond. All clear quartz with some traces of aluminum becomes smoky when irradiated with \u03b3-rays or neutrons, and irradiation also enhances the purple color of amethyst. Commercially, the most important radiation treatment is employed to produce the highly popular blue topaz, which is rare in nature.

Some of these radiation-induced colors are not permanent and disappear if crystals are ex- posed to ultraviolet light or are slightly heated. In addition, caution is advised with radiation- treated gemstones, as sometimes radioactivity is maintained for extended periods. Green dia- monds, in particular, should be tested with a Geiger counter. Thus identi\ufb01cations of gemstone enhance- ments are big challenges for jewelers and gemolo- gists. Some treatments have been historically ac- cepted in the jewelry industry (e.g., heat treat- ment of aquamarine), whereas others are con- troversial (e.g., fracture \ufb01llings of diamonds and emeralds). Jewelers have the delicate task to meet legal and ethical disclosure requirements to con- s u m e r s ,a n da tt h es a m et i m et op r e s e n tt h ei n - formation in a positive manner to maintain the interest of customers. There is a proliferation of new treatment techniques, some of which cor- respond closely to conditions in nature and are therefore dif\ufb01cult to detect. Crystal synthesis Because of the great value of gemstones, at- tempts have long been made to produce them synthetically. After many initial dif\ufb01culties, fairly straightforward methods have been developed to produce large crystals of gem-quality ruby, emer- ald, and even diamond, and there is a large and pro\ufb01table market for these synthetic gems. The methods are now used widely to produce crys- tals for many industrial applications as well. We discuss brie\ufb02y some of the principal methods in this section.

{"text": "duced by Auguste Victor Louis Verneuil in Paris with a rather ingenious gadget. The idea was to prepare \ufb01rst a \ufb01ne powder with the chemical composition of the desired \ufb01nal crystal (Al 2O3 and about 2% Cr 2O3 added for color). This pow- der was then dropped into a stream of hydro- gen gas in a pipe. The hydrogen ignited when it came into contact with oxygen and produced a downward-pointing \ufb02ame (Figure 31.7). In this \ufb02ame, at a temperature of up to 2200 \u25e6C, the pow- der melted and accumulated \ufb01rst as a cone. At the tip of the cone a crystal nucleus formed that grew into the shape of an inverse droplet, which was called a boule. The success in producing a per- fect ruby color hinged on using very pure starting materials, particularly materials without traces of iron. Verneuil ruby boules (Figure 31.8) were widely produced, and the process became re\ufb01ned over time. The \ufb02ame-fusion-produced synthetic rubies always display curved growth bands ow- ing to slight \ufb02uctuations in chromium content and are therefore easily distinguished from nat- ural rubies. There are large production facilities applying the Verneuil technique to produce gem- imitation rubies and sapphire, as well as crystals used as instrument bearings. The cost for pro- ducing such crystals is low and the gem growth is relatively rapid. Yet the growth heterogeneities proved detrimental for an important modern ap- plication of ruby in lasers, and thus a different", "page": 557}

As the current through the coil changes at high frequency, power is in- duced in any electrically conducting materials near the coil. A preferred crucible material for a high-temperature Czochralski apparatus is irid- ium, with a melting point of 2442 \u25e6C (compared to a melting point of 2050 \u25e6Cf o rA l2O3) (Figure 31.9). A control system is used to maintain the temperature just a few degrees above the melting point of ruby. A small seed crystal, a few millime- ters in length, is now touched to the surface of the melt. The seed crystal is rotated and slowly pulled vertically from the melt at a rate of 5--25 mm per hour. The process is carried out in an in- ert atmosphere, almost pure nitrogen, to prevent oxidation of the iridium crucible. The Czochralski method has become the preferred technique for producing silicon crys- tals used in the electronics industry and a large industrial Czochralski furnace is shown in Figure 31.10a.

The Czochralski method is also used for producing synthetic garnets such as YAG ( yttrium aluminum garnet) and GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet). YAG, doped with neodymium, is used in neodymium lasers, with an output wavelength of 1.06 \u03bcm in the infrared range. GGG is applied in the electronics industry as a substrate for magnetic bubble domain mem- ory units, which require perfect crystals without defects. This process also produces rubies used in lasers. Flux growth A method that relies on dissolving a material in a melt of a different composition, called a flux,a t higher temperature and then precipitating the material again at lower temperature was devel- oped mainly for producing synthetic emeralds. This process requires much lower temperatures than those needed to melt the actual gem mate- rial. A frequently used \ufb02ux for emerald synthesis is lithium molybdate (Li 2Mo2O7) with a melting p o i n to f7 0 5\u25e6C. The constituents of beryl -- Al2O3, SiO2, and BeO -- and a trace of Cr 2O3 added as a coloring agent are dissolved in the \ufb02ux at 800 \u25e6C. In order to have some convection in the \ufb02ux, a temperature gradient is obtained, as for exam- ple in the \ufb02ux cell illustrated in Figure 31.11, where the oxides dissolve in the hotter portion of the cell and the emerald grows from seeds in the cooler region. Emerald crystals up to 2 cm in diameter have been grown from \ufb02ux over periods of several months. Hydrothermal growth of quartz We discussed in Chapter 8 that quartz, with its noncentric crystal structure, has the property called piezoelectricity. If a stress is applied in cer- tain directions, an electric \ufb01eld is induced and vice versa. For this reason, quartz is employed widely technologically in electronic \ufb01lters and os- cillators to control the frequency of electrical os- cillations with superb precision. There is a large demand for high purity and defect-free quartz for the radio and watch industries. Unfortunately, natural quartz is not only limited in supply but is also frequently internally twinned, which is not acceptable for piezoelectric application. Thus syn- thesis of large quartz crystals became a high pri- ority. Quartz is fairly insoluble in water, even at 100 \u25e6C. This insolubility changes considerably if water is heated to 400 \u25e6C at high pressure, cor- responding to hydrothermal conditions (see Fig- ure 16.3).

In the upper, cooler region, the \ufb02uid can no longer hold all the silica in solu- tion, and thus quartz crystallizes on the quartz seeds. The colder, denser solution sinks by con- vection and the cycle is repeated. It is desirable for quartz crystals not to grow too rapidly; oth- erwise, defects are introduced. A growth veloc- ity of 1 mm per day is generally applied in in- dustrial applications, and crystals of sizes up to 30 cm, weighing several pounds, are grown over the course of a few months. The morphology of the crystals is controlled by the shape of the seed crystals and the way that they are oriented in the convection current. The morphology is op- timized for piezoelectric applications and often emphasizes a basal face (or close to it) or a mi- nor rhombohedron (01 \u00af11) = z (Figure 31.13). The hydrothermal technique described above is also employed for industrial and gem manufacturing of ruby and emerald. Ultra-high pressure With diamond being the most precious of gem- stones, it is not surprising that huge efforts have been made to synthesize it. Unlike the other gem- stones discussed in this section whose synthesis relies on high temperature, diamond is the high- pressure polymorph of carbon that is stable at room temperature above 1.9 GPa. The pioneer of high-pressure synthesis, which is of tremendous importance for geology and geophysics, is Percy Williams Bridgman, and his research earned him the Nobel prize for Physics in 1946. He designed what became known as the piston cylinder ap- paratus. The idea behind this device is to exert a force with a relatively small piston on a sam- ple that is shielded with a high strength steel or tungsten carbide cylinder (Figure 31.14). The force", "page": 560}

The sample is sealed within the cylinder, for example with a sleeve made of pyrophyllite, to prevent it from extruding. A furnace can also be applied to heat the sample. With this appa- ratus, Bridgman reached conditions in the dia- mond stability \ufb01eld (e.g., 3.5 GPa at 2000 \u25e6C), but at that temperature kinetics prevented diamond from crystallizing. The original Bridgman design was modi\ufb01ed to include a concentric set of cylinders of different high-strength materials and pistons (called belt apparatus) for higher strength and a geometry with tapered pistons. With this device, pressures of 20 GPa and temperatures of 5000 \u25e6C could be reached simultaneously and maintained over many hours (Figure 31.15a). But physics alone was insuf\ufb01cient to produce diamonds -- chemistry was also needed. In 1954, H. Tracy Hall, head- ing a team from the US \ufb01rm General Electrics, combined the high-pressure technology and the thermodynamics of the carbon system to produce the \ufb01rst signi\ufb01cant synthetic diamonds. The chemistry is best understood by returning to the phase diagram introduced in Figure 20.2. At low temperature, graphite does not convert to diamond for kinetic reasons. Hall proposed that a method similar to \ufb02ux growth, but at high pres- sure, might solve the problem. The idea was to dissolve graphite in a molten metal and then recrystallize it from the melt as diamond, at a lower temperature (Figure 31.16).", "page": 561}

Graphite is dissolved in the nickel, and a \ufb01lm of metal moves across the sample, leaving behind carbon that crystallizes as diamond. In the \ufb01rst experiment, Hall observed diamond crystals 100--150 \u03bcm in diameter. Since then, the technique has been re\ufb01ned using dia- mond seeding, and several companies now pro- duce large quantities of small diamonds that are used mainly for industrial applications, although many are of gem quality. Understandably there is much secrecy about diamond synthesis. Gen- eral Electric produces about 100 million carats a year for industrial applications. De Beers has sev- eral patents for manufacturing gem-quality dia- monds, but the production costs are still higher than for natural diamonds, and therefore sin- gle crystals of diamond have been manufactured only on a very small scale. Crystals up to 5 mm in diameter are used mainly in the semiconductor industry. Some of the largest synthetic diamonds weigh about 100 carats (20 g) (Plate 9b). The shape of the crystals depends on the temperature un- der which they form. Cube faces {100} form at 1300 \u25e6C, whereas at 1600 \u25e6C octahedra faces {111} dominate. T est your knowledge 1.

{"text": "Chapter 32 Cement minerals Signi\ufb01cance of cement Concrete is the most widely used structural mate- rial in the world today. Each year 1 billion tonnes of Portland cement are converted into 11.5 billion t o n n e so fc o n c r e t ea tav a l u eo f9 0b i l l i o nU S dollars, more than one tonne for every human being. This is about \ufb01ve times the tonnage of steel consumption. Even though concrete is consider- ably weaker than steel, it is preferred for several reasons. One reason is its excellent resistance to water. Some of the earliest applications were in the construction of aqueducts and waterfront re- taining walls by the Romans. Today it is widely used in the construction of dams and offshore oil platforms, for example in the North Sea. A sec- ond reason is the ease with which concrete can be formed into almost any shape and size. Freshly made concrete is of a plastic consistency and can be poured into any prefabricated form. After a few hours it solidi\ufb01es into a hardened and strong mass. Finally, at about $US 20 per tonne, concrete is the cheapest and most readily available build- ing material, compared for example with steel ($US 500 per tonne). Concrete is a composite material that essen- tially consists of a binding medium or cement that is combined with fragments of rocks, the so-called aggregate (Figure 32.1). The aggregate is granular material such as sand, gravel or crushed rock. There are two types of cement, hydraulic and nonhydraulic. Hydraulic cements not only harden by reacting with water but also form a water- resistant product. Cements derived from calci- nation (i.e., obtaining calcium oxide by heating) of gypsum or carbonates, such as limestone, are nonhydraulic, because their products are subject to dissolution and are not resistant to water. Lime mortars that were used in structures by the Ancient Greeks and Romans were rendered hy- draulic by the addition of \u2018\u2018pozzolanic\u2019\u2019 material, a volcanic ash that reacted with lime to produce a water-resistant cementitious product. (Pozzuoli is a town near Naples where volcanic ash was mined.) Concrete has many analogies with rocks. The closest analogy is a cemented limestone, in which sand grains are held together by a ma- trix with crystals of quartz or calcite. In concrete these minerals are far more complex and often not very well de\ufb01ned. In this chapter we will look brie\ufb02y at \u2018\u2018cement minerals\u2019\u2019 and the reactions by which they form, and by which they transform into new phases. There has been much recent interest in bet- ter understanding the processes that take place during the hardening of cement, and even more importantly the changes that occur owing to cor- rosion and deterioration. It is a large \ufb01eld of re- search that is generally pursued with the same methods as used in mineralogy: these methods include characterization using the techniques described in Chapter 12, application of chemi- cal thermodynamics and", "page": 564}

Some features of nonhydraulic cements Gypsum cement is still widely used as plaster of Paris for interior applications. The transforma- tion of natural gypsum to anhydrite by heat treat- ment at 130--150 \u25e6C is described by the following chemical reaction: 2CaSO4 \u00b72H2O \u2192 CaSO4 \u00b7 1 2 H2O + CaSO4 + 3 1 2 H2O Gypsum Hemihydrate Anhydrite Vapor (gypsum cement) During curing, this reaction is reversed by adding water to gypsum cement and obtaining a hard and coherent gypsum aggregate. Unfortunately gypsum is very soluble in water. A better nonhydraulic cement is lime, which has been used extensively in Europe and the Mid- dle East throughout antiquity, the Middle Ages, and well into the nineteenth century, and by the Mayas in Mexico. Lime is formed by decarbona- tion of calcite by heating at 900--1000 \u25e6C: CaCO3 \u2192 CaO + CO2 Calcite Quick lime Gas Mixing the powder of quick lime with water pro- duces a cement paste that quickly reacts and hardens by forming hydrated lime CaO + H2O \u2192 Ca(OH)2 Lime Water Hydrated lime Concrete with hydrated lime is not stable over long periods because Ca(OH) 2 is soluble in water. However, if the exposure to water is not excessive, Ca(OH)2 slowly carbonates in air to form stable calcite: Ca(OH)2 + CO2 \u2192 CaCO3 + H2O Hydrated lime Calcite Vapor When pozzolan (a volcanic ash rich in reactive silica) is added to the system, a calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) is formed that is stable in water: CaO + SiO2 + H2O \u2192 CaSiO2(OH)2 Lime Silica Water C-S-H Portland cement Portland cement is de\ufb01ned as a \u2018\u2018hydraulic ce- ment\u2019\u2019 that is produced by pulverizing a mixture of calcium silicates and calcium carbonates that also contains some aluminum and iron oxides. These raw materials are obtained by heating a mixture of limestone and clay at very high tem- perature. Portland cement was \ufb01rst produced in 1824 in England, although a very similar method was used by the Romans but then forgotten. In a clever marketing strategy it was named after the island of Portland (UK), where gray granite oc- curs that was highly popular at that time. Since then it has, with only minor changes, become the standard cement for most concrete applications. In a cement factory (Figure 32.2) limestone and clay are mixed and then milled for better reac- tivity and subsequently heated in a rotating kiln to a temperature of 1450 to 1550 \u25e6C. The reaction produces nodules 5--30 mm in diameter that are called clinker. About 5% gypsum is added to the clinker to control the early setting and hardening reactions of the cement. The composite is then ground to <75 \u03bcm in diameter. This process re- leases large quantities of CO 2, through burning as well as decomposition of carbonates.

Limestone and clay are mixed and then heated in a kiln to form clinker. Gypsum is added to the clinker, and the mixture is then ground to the \ufb01nal product, Portland cement. The main minerals in clinker are tricalcium silicate (Ca3SiO5), also called alite, and dicalcium silicate (Ca 2SiO4) called belite. Belite has a struc- ture similar to that of olivine, with calcium sub- stituting for magnesium. In detail the packing of oxygen ions around calcium is irregular, with O \u2212 concentrated on one side of each Ca 2+. This leaves large structural holes that account for the high lattice energy and reactivity, particularly in the case of alite. If you read the cement literature you will come across a new nomenclature that is confusing at \ufb01rst. Each oxide is abbreviated with a letter, and compounds are given symbols ac- cording to the relative amount of oxides present in them (Table 32.1). In the language of cement research, Port- land cement has an approximate composition of: 55% C3S (Ca3SiO5), 25% C2S (Ca2SiO4), 12% C3A (Ca3Al2O6), and 8% C4AF (Ca4Al2Fe2O10). Clinker phases are easily recognized in an X-ray powder diffraction pattern (Figure 32.3).

Within a few minutes, needle-shaped crystals of C6AS3H32 (Ca6Al2S3O18\u00b732H2O) called ettringite (which is also a rare, naturally occurring mineral) appear (Fig- ure 32.5a). Also large prismatic or plate-like crys- tals of calcium hydroxide CH (Ca(OH)2) (with the mineral name portlandite, derived from Portland cement, not Portland Island, UK) form (Figure 32.5b). Portlandite is stoichiometric and forms large crystals constituting 20--25% of the volume. Its presence has an adverse effect on strength and durability. Later, very small crystals of cal- cium silicate hydrates C-S-H begin to \ufb01ll the empty space, formerly occupied by water. C-S-H is not a well-de\ufb01ned compound and its com- position can vary considerably with tempera- ture, age of hydration and the water:cement ra- tio, therefore the notation C-S-H is used. On complete hydration, the approximate composi- tion is C3S2H3 (Ca3Si2O4(OH)6). C-S-H comprises 50--60% of the volume of the paste. The morphol- ogy varies from minute \ufb01bers to a network. The crystal structure is still not resolved but it has some similarities with the chain silicate min- erals tobermorite (Ca 5H2(Si3O9)2\u00b74H2O) and jennite (Ca9(Si3O9)2(OH)6\u00b78H2O), both related to wollas- tonite. C-S-H has an extremely high surface en- ergy, providing strength through van der Waals forces (interlayer spaces are about 18 \u02daA). After a few days of hydration, ettringite becomes unsta- ble and decomposes to form monosulfate hydrate ( C4ASH12), which has hexagonal plate morphol- ogy. Figure 32.6 is a sketch of a typical con- crete microstructure. Heterogeneity is present at various scales. Pores in C-S-H are around 50 \u02daA, and capillary voids occur in all sizes and shapes, from a few nanometers to micrometers.

Two important hydration reactions are exothermic, i.e., heat is released: 2C3S + 6H \u2192 2Ca3SiO5 6H2O Alite Water C3S2H3 + 3CH + heat(120 cal/g) Ca3Si2O4(OH)6 3Ca(OH)2 (C-S-H) Portlandite 2C2S + 4H \u2192 2Ca2SiO4 4H2O Belite Water C3S2H3 + CH + heat(70 cal/g) Ca3Si2O4(OH)6 Ca(OH)2 (C-S-H) Portlandite The heat released during these reactions can be detrimental for the curing process and, if con- crete is applied in large quantities, it needs to be cooled. For example, in large concrete structures such as the Hoover Dam, thermal stresses can be- come very high and considerable efforts are made to reduce the temperature rise inside the con- crete mass. This can be done by using cements with low amounts of C3S (alite) and CA,b y using ice instead of water, or by installing cooling pipes inside the dam. Clinkers rich in C3S are preferred for colder climates, whereas those rich in C2S (belite) are more often used for hot weather conditions. Some problems with concrete There are several problems related to the dete- rioration of concrete and, since concrete is the major construction material for bridges, high- ways, and many buildings, the stability of con- crete is of major economic importance. We are go- ing to brie\ufb02y discuss three issues: sulfate attack, the alkali silica reaction, and steel corrosion. Large research projects are dedicated to each and many mineralogists are engaged in the work. We will see that the reactions involved are similar to those that occur in mineral systems. To get an impression of the magnitude of the concrete problems, the US Federal Highway Administra- tion recently estimated that the cost of correct- ing damage to highways, bridges, and buildings amounts to over $US 150 billion dollars in the USA alone.", "page": 568}

Sulfate attack on the hardened cement paste in concrete manifests itself in the form of cracking, spalling, increased permeability, and loss of strength. Therefore, concrete structures exposed to sulfate water must be designed for sulfate resistance. Sulfate attack occurs when sulfate ions pene- trate the concrete from the surrounding environ- ment. As the sulfate ions permeate the concrete, they react with portlandite to form gypsum, which is accompanied by a large volume increase and causes expansion and cracking. Ca(OH)2 + SO2\u2212 4 + 2H2O \u2192 Portlandite Water CaSO4 \u00b72H2O + 2OH\u2212 /Delta1V = 123% Gypsum where /Delta1V is the increase in volume. For industrial Portland cements, monosulfate hydrate (C4ASH18), which is a major component of fully hydrated hardened cement, reacts with gypsum to form secondary ettringite ( C6AS3H32, trisulfate hydrate). This reaction also causes ex- pansion of the solid components: Ca4Al2SO10\u00b718H2O + 2CaSO4 \u00b72H2O + 10H2O \u2192 Monosulfate hydrate Gypsum Water Ca6Al2S3O18\u00b732H2O /Delta1V = 57% Ettringite In the presence of portlandite (CH), the monosul- fate hydrate (C4ASH18) is converted to ettringite when the hydrated cement paste comes into con- tact with a sulfate ( S). Ca4Al2SO10\u00b718H2O + 2Ca(OH)2 + 2SO3 + 14H2O \u2192 Monosulfate hydrate Portlandite Water Ca6Al2S3O18\u00b732H2O /Delta1V = 91% Ettringite Note that all these reactions have a volume in- crease and the formation of gypsum and ettrin- gite by sulfate attack causes internal stresses. Details of these sulfate reactions are still not clear and are under much investigation. The re- actions are dependent on the pH of the attacking Aggregate Transition zone Bulk cement paste C6AS3H32 (Ettringite) CH (Portlandite) Fig. 32.6 Schematic cross-section through aggregate and cement paste showing transition zone and bulk zone with different composition and microstructure (after Mehta and Monteiro, 1993). sulfate solution, which is governed by the sulfate ion concentration. Weak sulfate solutions can re- act with the aluminate constituents of cement to form ettringite. Stronger solutions are some- what acidic and capable of forming gypsum as a result of chemical reaction with portlandite. Highly acidic solutions can even decompose C-S-H. Alkali\u2013silica reaction The second destructive problem is also of di- rect mineralogical signi\ufb01cance. In the 1920s and 1930s, extensive cracking appeared within a few years of construction in a number of bridges and pavements along the US Californian coast from Monterey County to Los Angeles County. This could be attributed to a reaction of the opa- line and cherty aggregate, which is a common rock in this region, and alkalis present in the cement paste. In theory, any aggregate contain- ing silica has the potential to participate in the alkali--silica reaction. Yet it is siliceous minerals with disordered, amorphous, or defect-rich", "page": 569}

{"text": "556 CEMENT MINERALS in metamorphic rocks. If the aggregate contains signi\ufb01cant amounts of such forms of silica, sil- ica reacts with alkali ions that are present in the pore system of the cement paste, or enter from external sources (e.g., Na + from de-icing salts). This reaction produces a gel that transforms from an amorphous solid ultimately to a liquid phase, as water is taken into the structure. The initial hydrolysis of the siliceous fraction of the aggre- gate destroys the aggregate integrity and opens a pore system through which water can perco- late. Swelling of the alkali silicate gel causes local stresses and cracking. This reaction occurs only if water is present and distress in structures is generally observed after 5--10 years: 2(K, Na)OH + SiO2 + 2H2O \u2192 K2ONa2OSiO2 \u00b73H2O Alkali ions Silica Water Gel This reaction indicates that, in constructions with concrete, much attention ought to be paid to the mineralogical composition of the aggre- gate. Corrosion Structural concrete is usually designed in com- bination with reinforcing steel bars to increase the low tensile strength of the concrete. The al- kaline environment of the concrete provides an excellent protection for the steel, suppressing its tendency to corrode when exposed to the exter- nal natural environment. However, if solutions enter the concrete, for example in combination with sulfate attack or the alkali--silica reaction, corrosion does occur, producing serious struc- tural damage. Corrosion of embedded steel re- inforcing bars is a destructive electrochemical process that ultimately weakens concrete struc- tures. Since corrosion products have a greater volume than the original steel reinforcing bars, internal stresses will develop in the cement mor- tar, at the steel/mortar interface. As a result, the surrounding concrete will crack and eventually spall away. The structural integrity of the con- crete is increasingly compromised as cracking progresses. With the steel corroding away, the re- inforcing bar cross-section is reduced, decreasing the member\u2019s tensile strength. Thus corrosion of steel reinforcement and the associated concrete cracking leads to a loss of both tensile strength of the steel and compressive strength of the concrete. Corrosion is essentially an electrochemical process. It involves the formation of a cathode and an anode, with an electrical current \ufb02ow- ing between the two (cf. the discussion in Chap- ters 17 and 23). The anode is the steel bar. The cathode is located at a point where oxygen can enter by diffusion. At the anode, metallic iron is oxidized to Fe 2+, which dissolves and is trans- ported to a cathode, where OH \u2212 is produced. The Fe2+ and OH \u2212, which are moving in pore solu- tions, interact chemically to produce iron hydrox- ide at the anode, a reaction with a large volume increase. Fe + 1 2 O2 + H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)2 /Delta1V = 272% In general, the corrosion process occurs when metals revert back to lower energy states. Sev- eral conditions are required for corrosion to oc- cur in an aerobic environment. The system must have an anode to produce", "page": 570}

This is usually satis\ufb01ed by the metallic reinforcement and depends on microstructural defects in the metal and the presence of protective \ufb01lms. In addition, there has to be availability of oxygen and water at the cathode site as well as an electrical con- nection between the anode and cathode sites to transfer electrons and this depends on the prop- erties of the cement, which can be viewed as a two-phase material composed of hydrated solid minerals and a pore \ufb02uid. The structure, size, distribution, and interconnection of the pores in the cement paste, in conjunction with the presence of cracks and microcracks, control the permeability of concrete. The more permeable the concrete, the greater the availability of oxy- gen and water at the cathode for electrochem- ical reactions. The corrosion process cannot oc- cur without the availability of oxygen at the ca- thodic site. However, it has been established that even very dense concrete is fairly permeable to oxygen.

There are many examples where biologists, physicians, pharma- cists, and environmental health professionals rely on the expertise provided by mineralo- gists. On the one hand, minerals may consti- tute health hazards. Exposure to asbestos, toxic waste from mining operations, or radiation due to radioactive decay may cause cancer or other diseases. On the other hand, minerals such as salt and calcium are essential nutritional compo- n e n t sa n d ,a sw eh a v es e e ni nC h a p t e r2 3 ,b o t h bones and teeth are composed of mineral-like crystals. Minerals are also extensively used in beauty and grooming products. For example, talc is an important ingredient of many cosmetic products, baby powder being one of the better known ones. Minerals such as kaolinite, smectite, nontronite, biotonite, and hectorite clays are used in cosmet- ics, toothpaste, and pharmaceuticals, while mica provides the sheen in lipstick. Most consumers are generally unaware of most of these mineral ingredients. In this chapter we will explore some of the aspects of minerals related to human health, in both positive and negative ways. In so doing, we will see that our overall health and well- being is intimately connected with the world of minerals. Mineral-like materials in the human body The principal mineral-like compounds in humans are phosphates, but other mineral-like crystals occur as well (Table 33.1). Bones of adults con- sist of approximately 70% calcium phosphate and 30% organic matter. Calcium phosphate forms tiny prismatic crystals less than 1000 \u02daA in length, with a structure and composition similar to that of apatite (Ivanova et al., 2001). Organic mat- ter contains combinations of different collagens, fats, and proteins. The apatite crystallites line up in chains and, together with organic material, form \ufb01bers of bone tissue. A portion of the phos- phate material of newborns is amorphous. As a child grows, the amorphous material and the ex- isting crystals increase in size. At the same time the portion of organic material decreases with age, with the result that the \ufb01bers lose their elas- ticity and the bone tissue becomes more brittle. Recent investigations with high-voltage elec- tron microscopic tomography revealed structural relationships between collagen \ufb01bers and apatite crystallites (Landis et al., 1996). For example, the crystals in an embryonic chicken bone are only 800 \u02daA \u00d7 300 \u02daA \u00d7 80 \u02daA (Figure 33.1a), the largest dimension being along the c-axis of the hexago- nal mineral. A computerized reconstruction indi- cates that apatite c-axes are parallel to the long axis of the collagen \ufb01bers and connect the \ufb01bers. Furthermore, they are stacked in a regular pat- tern (Figure 33.1b).", "page": 572}

A number of PO3\u2212 4 tetrahedra in the structure are replaced by CO3OH3\u2212 or CO 2\u2212 3 groups. The main crystalline phase in cartilage is also biogenetic phosphate, analogous to apatite and constituting about 5% of the volume. Modi\ufb01cations of apatite form 96% of tooth enamel (the outer coating of teeth) and 70% of dentine (the material beneath the enamel), with the rest of tissue volume com- posed of proteins. In tooth enamel, some OH \u2212 is r e p l a c e db yF\u2212, which makes teeth more resis- tant to decay. In enamel, crystals are organized in a layered structure to improve mechanical properties (Figure 33.2, see also Figure 23.6). Crystals may also grow abnormally within the human body. Aggregations of biogenetic apatite up to 2 cm in size have been discovered in some malignant tumors.

The former are required in rather large quantities in our daily diet, while the latter are also essential for physiological functions, but only in trace amounts. Table 33.3 lists some of the physiological functions of macro- and mi- crominerals. Ultimately most of these elements are derived from \u2018\u2018real minerals\u2019\u2019, but indirectly through a long chain of natural events. Primary minerals in rocks decompose to clay minerals that become part of soils. Plants growing on those soils accumulate the inorganic elements and store them in roots and leaves. Animals eat the plants and transfer the elements into their tissue, and \ufb01nally humans acquire these elements largely by consuming either plants or animals. The quantity of elements stored in plants is considerable, particularly in the green parts (e.g., average contents on a moisture-free basis in some legumes and grasses are Ca 1--4 weight%, P 0.1--0.5 weight%, Fe 100--200 ppm, Cu 5--15 ppm). These amounts vary greatly with the mineral content of the soil, but they are also affected by many other factors such as climate and elemental balance. The mineral content of plants can have a direct effect on the health of animals. It has been observed that cattle grazing in pastures with underlying limestone are less likely to develop bone diseases than those grazing on granitic soils. The trace element selenium, an essential antioxidant to preserve the cellular membrane, can become toxic if con- centrations are too high, as in some sedimentary", "page": 575}

Conversely, a lack of selenium in the diet of endangered Bighorn Sheep was recently implicated in the low survival rate of newborn lambs. In human nutrition, calcium, magne- sium, phosphorus, and copper are stored in legumes, whereas chromium, iron, manganese, and zinc are enriched in cereals. A number of drugs used in the treatment of internal and external diseases contain miner- als. The halide mineral bischo\ufb01te (MgCl 2\u00b76H2O), for example, is used for treating arthritis and rheumatic fever. Calcite, dolomite and apatite are used as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus supplements. Direct ingestion of soils as a food supple- ment and medicine, known as geophagy, is com- mon among some primates and is still practiced in some countries by humans. Ancient Greeks and Romans used tablets of soil as a remedy against poisoning. Traditionally and until fairly recently, soils were consumed in China as famine food. Well into the eighteenth century, clay was mixed with \ufb02our in the preparation of bread. Pomo Indians in northern California (USA) mixed clay with ground acorns to neutralize the acid- ity. The most widespread incidence of geophagy is in Central Africa, as well as among some African Americans in the southern USA. In Africa geophagic clays are widely used by pregnant women as food supplements containing elements such as phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, cop- per, zinc, manganese, and iron, and as remedies against diarrhea. Interestingly the chemical com- position of these soils and soil extracts is re- markably similar to modern commercial mineral- nutrient substitutes. The main clay mineral in geophagic soils is kaolinite. Soils rich in smectite are less desirable because of their swelling prop- erties (see Chapter 27).

We are exposed to minerals daily, often without being aware of it. Many workers, in- cluding miners, quarry workers, sandblasters, stone masons, and agricultural workers, are ex- posed to dust from a variety of sources and inhale small mineral fragments.

Recently several other amphibole minerals (winchite, rich- terite, and arvedsonite) have been implicated as causing cancer in workers at the Libby, Montana (USA), vermiculite mines, and the Environmental Protection Agency is currently reviewing whether the existing asbestos regulations in the USA should be extended to include these minerals. A brief review of these disease-causing miner- als and the methods used to assess and monitor their presence is given below. The \ufb01rst reported case of the lung disease as- bestosis was in 1927 in a chrysotile textile worker. Ten years later asbestosis became generally ac- cepted by the industry as an occupational dis- ease with distinct characteristics. Stanton et al. (1981) demonstrated with a classical, though still controversial, epidemiological study that rats ex- posed to \ufb01brous asbestos dust developed carcino- genic tumors (Figure 33.4). In the Stanton et al. study, rats exposed to equivalent amounts of nonasbestos dust (such as talc) did not develop the diseases. The researchers concluded that the \ufb01brous morphology caused the disease. Since then, much further research has been done, and the \ufb01brous morphology of asbestos has, in fact, been found to be only part of the reason that as- bestos is harmful.

The harmful effect of asbestos dust is in part dependent on the physical shape of the par- ticles, and the \ufb01brous morphology of asbestos is particularly detrimental. However, it appears that the relative ability of the body to dissolve these materials is also of key importance. As- bestos is much less soluble in the body than are nondisease-causing \ufb01brous minerals. Equally sig- ni\ufb01cant is the surface chemistry and reactivity of the particles. For example, fresh surfaces of minerals, exposed by fracture, are highly reac- tive owing to the presence of under-coordinated surface atoms and broken bonds that accompany them. It has been observed that generation of free radicals by increased grinding of chrysotile \ufb01bers reduces the hemolytic activity because the parti- cles become less crystalline. In chrysotile \ufb01bers enclosed in tissue, magnesium is preferentially leached from the \ufb01ber. If the surface chemistry of chrysotile is modi\ufb01ed with polymers adsorbed to the particles, the toxic effect can be dramati- cally reduced. As we have seen in Chapter 27, tetrahedral-- octahedral sheets in chrysotile are rolled up similar to a scroll (see Figure 27.5). The outside of the \u2018\u2018scroll\u2019\u2019 is made up of the magnesium octa- hedral sheet, consisting of hydroxyl atoms on the surface that can be imaged with atomic force mi- croscopy (AFM) (Figure 33.6). Each bright node in this image represents a hydroxyl on the surface, and each gray triangular region is a magnesium ion. It is on this surface that the chrysotile reacts with biological tissue. In the case of chrysotile, this surface is charge-balanced and fairly regular. In the amphibole crocidolite, the surface is dominated by {110} cleavages parallel to the sili- cate chains. The surface structure is much more irregular, containing not only OH \u2212 but also tetra- hedral Si 4+, octahedral Mg 2+/Fe2+, and larger cations (Ca 2+,N a +). During dissolution, amphi- boles become depleted in iron, sodium, calcium, and magnesium. If iron is oxidized during the leaching process, it reprecipitates as ferric oxy- hydroxide. Analyses of leached crocidolite \ufb01bers in human tissue display amorphous surface lay- ers. Because of these layers, crocidolite \ufb01bers have a much longer lifetime than chrysotile, and for this reason crocidolite is more pathogenic. Exposure to quartz dust leads to silicosis,a progressive lung disease characterized by the development of scar tissue. Inhalation of quartz particles 0.5--0.7 /H9262m in size causes proteins to develop that surround the particles, stimulat- 0.4 nm Fig. 33.6 AFM image showing the atomic arrangement in the surface of lizardite, with a hexagonal pattern of hydroxyl ions (bright spots) and magnesium ions in depressions (gray) (from Wicks et al., 1992).", "page": 578}

As silicosis progresses, nodules coalesce and lesions develop that may involve one third of the lung, leading ultimately to respiratory failure. Silicosis has symptoms similar to those of asbestosis. Un- like asbestos exposure, however, there is no clear evidence for a relationship between lung cancer and silicosis. Coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis is caused by \ufb01ne- grained coal dust composed of carbonaceous ma- terial. Dust-laden cells form a mantle around respiratory bronchioles, which dilate as the mantle enlarges, causing emphysema. Pneumo- coniosis often takes many years to develop and, unlike silicosis, there is often no progression of this disease in the absence of further exposure. These lung diseases illustrate that the interac- tion of \ufb01bers with human tissue is very complex. Fibers with minor differences in composition and defect structure may have quite different biolog- ical activities. For example, glass \ufb01bers are not dangerous because they maintain their mechani- cal integrity and their dissolution rate is orders of magnitude faster than that of crystalline \ufb01bers. Particle analysis The assessment of hazardous concentrations of mineral particulates in the environment requires a combination of standardized industrial hygiene site-assessment techniques and mineralogical an- alytical procedures. We discuss these procedures in some detail because a fair number of min- eralogists \ufb01nd employment in this \ufb01eld. The industrial hygiene assessment techniques typi- cally involve a variety of sampling procedures (air drawn into membrane \ufb01lters, wiping or vacu- uming of known areas, direct sampling of build- ing materials or rock/soil, etc.). The mineralog- ical procedures typically include the use of a polarized light microscope (PLM), phase contrast microscope (PCM), and transmission electron mi- croscope (TEM) for asbestos, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) for quartz. In the case of airborne particles, a known vol- ume of air is collected onto a special type of mem- brane \ufb01lter. Analysis of the particulate found on the \ufb01lter is then performed using the appropri- ate technique. For asbestos air samples, a section of an air \ufb01lter is either (1) mounted on a glass slide and saturated with a special immersion oil for examination with a PLM or PCM or (2) pre- pared to create a carbon \ufb01lm replica of the \ufb01l- ter surface for examination with a TEM. Figure 33.7a is a PLM image of amosite. Figure 33.7b and c are TEM images of amosite and chrysotile, re- spectively, each with a characteristic morphology. The number of \ufb01bers in a given area is counted and, if the volume of air sampled is known, the number of \ufb01bers per unit volume of air (mea- sured as \ufb01bers per cubic centimeter) can be calcu- lated. For example, in the USA the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has es- tablished a permissible time-weighted exposure limit for workers at 0.1 \ufb01bers per cubic centime- ter of air during an 8 hour work day. Many other countries have similar regulations.", "page": 579}
{"text": "In the case of asbestos bulk samples of build- ing materials and rock/soil samples, a differ- ent technique called optical polarized light mi- croscopy is generally used. It involves taking a small sample of the bulk material, mounting it in immersion oil (see Chapter 10), and identifying the minerals present, quantifying the amount of asbestos by area estimate or by point count. It is a fairly straightforward, although tedious, tech- nique, which gives good general data on mass quantities of asbestos. A major limitation in the performance of as- bestos analysis is the fact that asbestos \ufb01bers are considered to be hazardous down to a length of 0.5 /H9262m, which is well below the resolution limit of optical microscopes. For the precise identi\ufb01ca- tion of the extremely small asbestos \ufb01bers, the TEM is the analytical method of choice, as it can easily resolve particles much smaller that 0.5 /H9262m (Figure 33.7b,c). Furthermore the mineral iden- tity of each individual asbestos \ufb01ber can be as- certained structurally by selected area electron diffraction (SAD) and chemically by energy dis- persive X-ray analysis (EDXA). Commercial testing laboratories that perform asbestos analysis must be certi\ufb01ed by government agencies to perform each speci\ufb01c type of test that they offer. To become certi\ufb01ed, they must pass a detailed inspection of their facilities and pass pro\ufb01ciency tests whereby blind samples are submitted to their facilities. Such laboratories employ a substantial number of mineralogists", "page": 579}

Chemical contamination from mining With the increasing industrialization of society, the demand for both metallic and non-metallic mineral products increases constantly. It is es- timated that about 1.5 billion tonnes of rock mass are excavated each year during mining of mineral resources. This causes irreparable dam- age to the environment. Open pit mines expand and deepen; underground mining causes subsi- dence; dumps of waste rocks grow and tailings of ore-dressing plants expand; the atmosphere be- comes polluted with gases from smelters, often enriched in SO 2 and CO2; and natural water sys- tems are also polluted. Soils in the vicinity of Sudbury in Canada, which is the world\u2019s largest nickel producer, have a pH of only 3 and this causes extensive loss of vegetation. Metals such as nickel, lead, and copper vaporize during the high temperatures of smelting and are dispersed over extensive areas surrounding the smelters (Figure 33.8). The most important pollutant of the hydro- s p h e r ei sH +, in the form of acid rain and acid mine drainage. Acid mine drainage results largely from the decomposition of pyrite to form iron hy- droxide, H + and SO2\u2212 4 . These reactions are often catalyzed by bacteria at low pH, increasing reac- tion rates by several orders of magnitude. Acid water produced by oxidation of sul\ufb01des can dis- solve other metal sul\ufb01des and leach metals that are adsorbed in clays, thereby increasing the trace metal content in streams. Extremely low pH, even negative, never observed in natural sys- tems, have been documented in mine waters in northern California (USA), and such acid waters have high concentrations of toxic metals such as arsenic, zinc, and cadmium. Many industrialized countries have put se- vere limitations on mining operations to main- tain some environmental standards. One of the \ufb01rst environmental mining laws was the prohi- bition of hydraulic mining in California (1860) to prevent erosion and destruction of fertile farm- land. Today in the USA, groundwater must be protected during mining operations, requiring elaborate schemes to ensure such protection. In", "page": 580}

The asymmetrical pattern is due to prevailing winds. Since then, the situation has much improved, but large concentrations of nickel and other heavy metal contaminants remain in soils. A zone of vegetation loss near Sudbury is shaded (after Semkin and Kramer, 1976). addition, mines must be restored to a natural state after mining operations cease. This so-called \u2018\u2018reclamation\u2019\u2019 is very costly, necessitating new ef\ufb01cient and effective technologies. Only a few years ago, the majority of mining mineralogists were engaged in prospecting and extraction tech- nologies. Today many are conducting research into remediation of environmental damage. Mod- ern mineral processing plants, at least in indus- trialized countries, must limit their emissions. The USA is the largest producer of SO 2 and CO2 emissions from all sources combined, and emis- s i o n so fS O 2 from mining and mineral process- ing still exceed 1000 tonnes per year. The result of such emissions is acid precipitation, which is prevalent in Eastern North America, Russia and many other parts of the word. Whitton and Diaz (1980) documented world- wide a dramatic decrease in the number of pho- tosynthetic organisms in rivers as zinc content increased (Figure 33.9). Compounding the prob- lem is that under anaerobic conditions, metal ions may form highly toxic organometallic com- p l e x e s ,s u c ha sm e t h y l a t e dm e r c u r y( C H 3Hg+). Natural waters acidi\ufb01ed by mine drainage have killed enormous numbers of \ufb01sh and benthic or- ganisms and have made groundwater unsafe for human consumption.

When this process was in extensive use, large amounts of mercury entered the at- mosphere and rivers. Amalgamation was largely replaced by the environmentally more benevo- lent cyanide process in the early 1900s, but high concentrations of mercury are still present in soils around old mining districts, as well as in sediments of regions that receive the stream and river drainage of these districts. An example is San Francisco Bay in California, which received deposits from streams draining Sierra Nevada mining districts, more than 160 km away, during the Gold Rush period of the 1850s.

{"text": "Chapter 34 Mineral composition of the solar system Elements in the universe According to current theory, the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago during a primordial explosion referred to as the \u2018\u2018Big Bang\u2019\u2019. Shortly af- ter the Big Bang, the \ufb01rst elements were formed, primarily helium and hydrogen (minor amounts of other light elements, such as lithium, beryl- lium and boron, also formed during this event). As the expanding universe continued to cool, ar- eas of higher density matter, or protogalaxies, be- gan to condense. As these early galaxies evolved, gravitational attraction between elements within the galaxies led to regions that collapsed under great pressure, triggering exothermic nuclear fu- sion reactions that resulted in the formation of the \ufb01rst stars. The nuclear reactions in the core of stars produce elements of light and interme- diate weight (up to iron and nickel), with the mass of a particular star determining just what elements may form during the course of its life- time. Our sun is a relatively nondescript star of the \u2018\u2018yellow dwarf \u2019\u2019 type; there are over one bil- lion such dwarfs in our galaxy alone. In small stars such as the sun, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and magnesium may form. In larger, more massive stars, however, heavier elements can syn- thesize, all the way up to iron. Magnesium, sili- con, and iron are the main elements produced in these stars, comprising less than 1% of the universe. Everything heavier than iron and nickel formed during stellar explosions known as super- novae, as a result of endothermic nuclear re- actions occurring at high pressure. Figure 34.1 is an optical image of the supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud, taken with the Hub- ble Space Telescope. How do we know the ele- mental composition of such remote objects? The answer is that these measurements are done with emission and absorption spectroscopic tech- niques very similar to those discussed in Chapter 12 and used to identify gems and other miner- als. Figure 34.2 shows absorption spectra of sev- eral supernovae, including that shown in Figure 34.1. White light produced in the supernova explosion undergoes absorption when passing through the dust ejecta. Absorption bands in the resulting spectra can be attributed to hydro- gen, helium, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, sili- con, sulfur, calcium, cobalt, and iron. The heav- ier elements cannot be measured directly, and their abundance must be inferred from model calculations. Thus all the earth elements heavier than iron were actually created in a supernova explosion somewhere else in our galaxy and then dispersed. The dispersed material eventually concentrated in nebulas, consisting mainly of hydrogen, he- lium, and minor amounts of lithium, beryllium, boron, magnesium, silicon, and iron. Dust par- ticles of Fe(Ni), MgO, SiO 2,M g 2SiO4 (forsterite), and MgSiO 3 (enstatite) precipitated during this process. These nebulas also contain molecular groups such as H 2,C O ,C N ,C H 4,N H 3,H 2O, HCOOH, H2CO, C2H6O, etc. The solar nebula formed about 5 billion years ago. As", "page": 584}

Some of these objects escaped later differentiation in the solar sys- tem because of their highly eccentric orbits (Figure 34.3). Comets and meteors are examples of such primitive material, and those that pass close to earth give scientists an opportunity to study the chemical as well as the mineralogical composition of the early solar system. For exam- ple, Halley\u2019s comet passed close to the earth in March 1986 and was investigated in detail. Com- pounds that were identi\ufb01ed in it include gas (H 2O 80%, CO 10%, CO2 3%, CH4 2%, NH3 1.5, HCN 0.1%) and small particles of solids 0.1--10 /H9262m in size. These particles turned out to be a mixture of H2O- ice and silicon--magnesium--iron--oxygen miner- als. Comet Hale-Bopp, observed in March 1997, has a similar composition. However, improved tech- niques for compositional determinations allowed many more molecular compounds to be identi- \ufb01ed in the gas, as well as dust particles of olivine and enstatite. The tail of the comet, 50 million kilometers in length, consists largely of sodium atoms.

These samples vary in their min- eral, chemical, and isotopic composition, and in their texture and structure. On the basis of these investigations, meteorites have been divided into four major classes: chondrites, achondrites, stony iron, and iron (Table 34.1). Chondrites are agglomerated rocks containing spherules up to 5 mm in size; these spherules (chondrules) can make up to 70% of a chondrite\u2019s total mass (Figure 34.4).

Ordinary chondrites are the most common va- riety of chondritic meteorites. High-temperature minerals such as olivine, enstatite, clinopyrox- ene, and sometimes plagioclase are major com- ponents of chondrules, and they are cemented with a matrix of the same \ufb01ne-grained miner- als, metals (Fe--Ni alloys), sul\ufb01des (troilite and others), and silicate glass. On average the compo- sition of ordinary chondrites is (in vol.%): olivine 40--45, enstatite 30, Ni--Fe alloys 10--15, plagio- clase 10, troilite 5--6. There is no consensus about the origin of chondrites. One group of theories assumes that chondrules formed directly out of the solar nebula gas. Another theory is that they formed during impacts on surfaces of meter-sized planetesimals. Enstatite chondrites have a composition close to that of early condensed material at 1300 K. They are characterized by a very high extent of re- duction consisting of iron-free enstatite, silicon- bearing kamacite (up to 3.5 weight% silicon), and troilite. These chondrites also contain some very rare and unusual minerals, such as alaban- dite ((Mn, Fe)S), niningerite ((Mg, Fe)S), oldhamite (CaS), and osbornite (TiN). Carbonaceous chondrites are characterized both by the highest degree of oxidation among all me- teorites and by high contents of water (up to 20 weight%, e.g., in serpentine and chlorite), carbon (up to 5 weight%, in graphite, amorphous carbon, organic matter such as polymers, and even traces of diamond), and sulfur (in gypsum and other sulfates).

Kamacite (body-centered cubic) and taen- ite (face-centered cubic) are often intergrown in a geometry called the Widmanst \u00a8atten pattern (see Figure 20.7) and form large crystals, suggesting that they were buried deep inside parent bodies and cooled very slowly. About 280 minerals are found in meteorites, and the majority of these are common on earth. Because a major part of iron exists in meteorites as native metal, the formation conditions for the meteorites must have been highly reducing, except in the case of carbonaceous chondrites. Native elements and metallic alloys found in me- teorites include kamacite, taenite, awaruite, lons- daleite, diamond, graphite, gold, copper, and sul- fur. There are also unusual carbides, silicides, nitrides, phosphides, and chlorides. Many sul- \ufb01des that are rare on earth are typical for mete- orites, including troilite, alabandite, oldhamite, brezinaite, daubreelite, and djer\ufb01sherite. Miner- als that have been found only in meteorites are listed in Table 34.2. The presence of diamonds in all types of me- teorites provides information about conditions in the early solar system. The diamond content of meteorites is generally about 0.1 vol.% but can occasionally reach 2%. Usually meteoritic diamonds are very \ufb01ne grained, but grains as l a r g ea s1 - - 5m mi nd i a m e t e rh a v ea l s ob e e no b - served. Figure 34.6 is a micrograph of such a dia- mond nanocrystal, only about 100 \u02daAi nd i a m e t e r , that is thought to be older than the solar sys- tem and formed during circumstellar condensa- tion. The diamonds in meteorites have a cubic, octahedral, or cube-octahedral habit. Graphite and lonsdaleite often form pseudomorphs after diamond. There are several diamond--mineral associ- ations in meteorites. The most common oc- currence is as inclusions in metallic phases (kamacite and taenite). The presence of native sil- icon and aluminum indicates an extremely re- ducing environment with a high H 2 pressure, which was a major compound of the original \ufb02uid envelopes of terrestrial planets. A second di- amond association includes carbide (SiC), troilite, daubreelite, cohenite, schreibersite, and spinel.

Olivine recrystallizes to form pure forsterite, enstatite, and native iron without nickel. To \ufb01nd carbon, hydrogen, and deuterium compounds in solar dust is not surprising since these elements are ubiquitous in the large outer planets. What is perhaps surprising is that aro- matic hydrocarbons are infrequently found in meteorites. The reason they are very rare in mete- orites has to do with the sampling. Both dust par- ticles and meteorites approach the earth at high velocities (>5k m / s ) .L a r g e rm e t e o r i t e sm u s tb e strong to survive the entry into the atmosphere and only coherent silicate and oxide rock frag- ments survive. The dust particles, with a high surface:mass ratio, decelerate much more gen- tly in the upper atmosphere, thus avoiding ex- cessive heating and allowing less stable organic molecules to survive atmospheric entry. Even though meteorites provide us with sam- ples from the remote solar system, this sampling is very incomplete. The source of the meteorite samples studied so far are only 70--80 parent bod- ies originating from the asteroid belt. Most of these meteorites formed before the oldest rocks of earth and moon as a result of impacts and collisions between planetesimals. Isotopic stud- ies indicate that most meteoritic material went from a condition of dispersed dust to incorpora- tion within solid bodies between 4560 and 4571 million years ago, i.e., within 10--20 million years of the beginning of the solar system. Isotopic ages were modi\ufb01ed by subsequent impacts, and most measured meteorite ages range between 4000 and 4500 million years ago, though a few are younger. Some carbonaceous chondrites may contain material that was formed earlier than the solar system, or that was carried from out- side its boundaries. In addition to the meteorites that originated from the asteroid belt, there are some unusual meteorites that are generally attributed to the moon and Mars.

These shells of the giant outer planets are to some extent still preserved, with those of Nep- tune and Uranus consisting mostly of H 2O and those of Saturn and Jupiter of helium--hydrogen. The protoplanets accumulated enormous masses, large enough for gravitational compression to produce thermal energy release and melting. This was followed by a stage of cooling and subse- quent layering into liquid outer shells and iron- silicate-enriched (chondritic) interiors, stimulat- ing an acceleration of the planetary rotation, development of centrifugal forces, and separa- tion of satellites from \ufb02uid shells of planets. In the inner terrestrial planets, the outer shells were blown away by the solar wind because of their proximity to the sun. The solar wind is an intense shower of protons and electrons originating from the sun and moving with a great velocity. In this scenario the earth, as well as Mars, Venus, and Mercury, lost most of their outer shells of light elements and with it over 95% of their mass at an early stage of aggregation. There are many other models for the early evo- lution of the solar system, and we cannot possibly discuss them all here. We instead turn brie\ufb02y to a description of the supposed mineralogical de- scription of the planets and their satellites. The planets of the solar system can be divided into two subgroups: four inner terrestrial planets, re- sembling the earth in size, density, composition, and surface temperature; and the remote giant gas planets, which are large in size, low in den- sity, are composed mainly of light elements, and have low surface temperatures (see Figure 34.3). The information about minerals of the plan- ets has up to now been based only on indirect data, except for a few meteorite fragments that are attributed to Mars. But, recently, amazing progress has been made in determining the el- emental composition of some planets and their satellites by analyzing their re\ufb02ected light spec- trum, just as is done for earth by means of re- mote sensing. Giant outer planets The spectacular NASA Voyager \ufb02yby missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune provided considerable information about the outer plan- ets and their satellites.

Since the outer planets are much farther from the sun than are the terrestrial planets, they were able to retain most of their volatile elements.

While the internal structure of these planets is not known, it is conjectured that they consist of small silicate or metallic cores, surrounded by large regions of liquid and gas. In particular, it is thought that Jupiter has a small silicate core, covered by a zone composed of metallic hydrogen, followed by a liquid hydrogen zone and a gaseous atmosphere.

The atmosphere of the giant planets, above their cloud tops, is roughly 75% H 2 and 25% He, with minor admixtures of CH 4,N H 3, and other gases. Compared to the solar nebula, the upper atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn are greatly depleted in helium, presumably because heav- ier helium gravitationally settled into the interi- ors of these planets. The atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune are enriched in helium, possibly be- cause hydrogen escaped from their atmospheres due to their lower gravitational \ufb01elds. The clouds of Jupiter and Saturn are composed of ammonia ice particles, whereas those of Uranus and Nep- tune consist of methane ice. Methane absorbs red preferentially from sunlight and is responsible for the blue appearance of Uranus and Neptune. In some respects, the moons of the giant planets are more comparable to the terrestrial planets than are their parent planets. For exam- ple, Jupiter\u2019s Io (3600 km in diameter), with an average surface temperature of 135 K, displays intense volcanism, with over 200 active hotspots, making this satellite the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Volcanism is very different from what it is on the earth at present, where it is caused by tectonic activity. On Io heat is generated by tidal \ufb02exing owing to the gravi- tational pull of Jupiter and its other satellites. There are huge lava \ufb02ows, over 250 km long (Figure 34.8a) and several eruptions on Io have been recorded by Voyager and Galileo spacecrafts and by the Hubble Space Telescope. Only a short time ago, it was assumed that unusual sulfur volcanism dominated on this satellite, in part because a large part of the surface is covered by SO 2 frost. Very recently, extreme temperatures of 1750 K and higher have been recorded with infrared spectrometers (Lopez et al., 2001). Such temperatures are incompatible with sulfur vol- canism and even with basaltic melts and suggest ultrama\ufb01c lavas (komatiites) that were common on earth during the Precambrian era (see Box 30.1). The three other large satellites of Jupiter -- Europa (3100 km in diameter), Ganymede (5300 km), and Callisto (4800 km) -- have surface tem- peratures between 125 and 170 K and are thought to be composed largely of water ice and silicate fragments. On Europa, there is good evidence for recent tectonic activity with large ridges and rifts visible in the ice that resemble the disruption of pack-ice on polar seas (Figure 34.8b). Callisto, on the other hand, shows no evidence for recent tectonism. The surface is fairly \ufb02at, with numer- ous impact craters having accumulated over long periods of time (Figure 34.8c). Saturn\u2019s largest satellite is Titan, which has a temperature of 95 K and a relatively thick hazy nitrogen atmo- sphere that covers large lakes of liquid methane below.

Clearly, with this amount of chemical di- versity, many crystalline compounds can occur (Table 34.3). Because of scienti\ufb01c interest in the moons of Jupiter, the chemical system H 2O--CH4 has been investigated in great detail at low temperature and high pressure, and many poly- morphs of ice were discovered in the course of these studies (see also Figure 17.1).

Not only did American astronauts \ufb01rst land on the moon, but they also brought samples back for laboratory studies. Prior to the analysis of these samples, there was much spec- ulation and uncertainty as to whether the moon would contain compounds that were totally dif- ferent from those that exist on earth. The answer was sobering: with the exception of three new minerals, all samples that were returned from the moon were composed of the same miner- als that are common in igneous rocks on earth. Only then was it realized that the moon was not primordial, but more like an evolved terrestrial planet, with all its complexities.

All minerals and rocks have been collected in the so-called re- golith, a thin cover of unconsolidated fragments on the surface of the moon that was formed by meteorite impacts. The samples were collected at only eight locations, none deeper than several centimeters, and therefore they do not necessar- ily provide a good average. Nevertheless, from surface observations and indirect geophysical evidence, there is some con- sensus that the moon, like the earth, consists of a crust, a mantle and a core (Figure 34.10b). A crustal layer 50--150 km thick is composed of anorthosites in the lunar highlands and of basalts in the maria regions, as is illustrated in the more detailed section in Figure 34.11. The crust covers a lithosphere that extends to a depth of 1000 km. The average composition of the man- tle is thought to be analogous to the earth\u2019s up- per mantle, with dunite (an olivine rock) and olivine pyroxenite, which is the ultimate source of mare basalts (Ringwood, 1979). Unlike the earth\u2019s mantle and crust, the lunar lithosphere is rigid, with no tectonic movements. Small moon- quakes have been recorded at a depth of about 1000 km, an indication of some tectonic activ- ity, perhaps at the interface of the lithosphere and a partially molten core. A primitive lunar core also exists, probably composed of andesite, gabbro, and, less likely, metallic iron.

Extensive melting of the outer 100--200 km layer occurred as a result of the impact of meteorites, gravitational compression, and heating of the lunar surface by solar wind. During this period a large outer magma ocean formed. As this liquid layer subsequently cooled, minerals began to crystallize and gravitational fractionation took place.

These mare basalts formed as a result of radioactive heating and crystallized near the surface. The main minerals of mare basalts are pyroxenes, plagioclase, olivine, and ilmenite. All igneous activity on the lunar surface had ceased by about 3 billion years ago. r In the \ufb01nal stage (3 billion years ago and later), slow erosion by means of meteoritic bombardments, the solar wind, and cosmic rays led to the destruction of the basalts and the formation of the regolith layer on the lunar surface. The regolith is a few tens of meters thick. In it are found KREEP rocks, which are metamorphosed, often glassy impact breccias. They are named after the \ufb01rst letters of the symbols or group names of the chemical elements in which they are slightly enriched (potassium, rare earth elements, phosphorus). A striking contrast between the earth and the moon is the absence of water on the lu- nar surface and crust, except for small amounts of ice discovered recently at the poles of the moon. This is the reason for the excellent preser- vation of old minerals on the surface and the lack of hydrothermal alteration and chemical weathering. The study of lunar pyroxenes has sig- ni\ufb01cantly contributed to our understanding of that mineral group and of the crystallization of basaltic melts. Unlike their lunar equivalents, py- roxenes in terrestrial rocks are often altered. The moon is also depleted relative to the earth in volatile elements such as sodium, potassium, and sulfur. It is signi\ufb01cant that the extraterrestrial ma- terials in meteorites, from the moon and from the planets that have been analyzed to date, contain many of the same minerals commonly found on earth, including olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase. However, if a mineralogy book were to concentrate on minerals in the universe, its emphasis would be different.

{"text": "Chapter 35 Mineral composition of the earth Chemical composition of the earth After Chapter 34\u2019s excursion into the mineralog- ical composition of the universe, we return to earth to review the most important mineral com- ponents of our planet. On earth, only miner- als located in the crust or suspended in the at- mosphere and hydrosphere (oceans, lakes, and rivers) are accessible to direct investigation. Ex- cept for a few locations, where upper mantle ma- terial has been juxtaposed with the crust, the mineralogical compositions of the deeper zones can only be inferred from indirect evidence pro- vided by studies of gravity, inertia, seismic wave propagation, magnetism, phase stability, and the general abundance of elements. Particularly important for determining the structure of the earth\u2019s interior are seismic waves. Their velocities increase with the elastic stiffness and the density of the material they pass through. Therefore one can draw conclu- sions about the material, on the basis of travel times. Furthermore (as was discussed brie\ufb02y in Chapter 8), there are two types of seismic waves. Longitudinal (or P waves) pass through solids as well as liquids, whereas transverse waves (S waves) pass through only solid material. This dis- tinction can be used to identify regions of melt within the earth. Figure 35.1 shows a pro\ufb01le of the average longitudinal and transverse wave velocity from the surface to the center of the earth, as well as the average increase in density and temper- ature. Note that the wave velocity graph shows both gradual changes (attributed to the general increase of velocity with pressure) and abrupt discontinuities, which are thought to be due to changes in composition or phase transforma- tions. Particularly striking is the discontinuity at 2900 km, where transverse waves vanish and the velocity of longitudinal waves drops from 14 to 8 km/s. This discontinuity is attributed to the tran- sition from the largely solid silicate mantle to the liquid iron core. It is generally believed that, except for the light elements such as hydrogen and helium, the bulk composition of the earth is similar to the av- erage composition of the solar system, probably best represented by the composition of stony me- teorites (see Table 34.5). Note that the whole earth is similar in composition to chondrites, whereas the moon corresponds to the composition of the earth\u2019s mantle. In this concluding chapter, we review brie\ufb02y the mineralogical composition of the different shells of the earth: crust, upper and lower man- tle, and core (see Figure 34.10a). Composition of the crust The bulk mineral composition of the crust can be estimated on the basis of the abundance of different types of rock in the crust as established by structural geology, combined with the actual (modal) mineral composition of those rocks. Such estimates have been done by many investigators, and a recent example is given in Table 35.1.", "page": 600}

On the whole, the mineral composition of the earth\u2019s crust is richer and more diverse than the compositions of the mantle and core, of meteorites, of the moon, and of other plan- ets. This mineralogical diversity results from sev- eral factors. (1) The crust evolved during a com- plex process of melting and differentiation of primary mantle material in the Precambrian Era.

Volcanic rocks are in parentheses. numerous phase transformations, and a more ho- mogeneous lower mantle (660--2900 km). The mineral composition of the upper mantle is best known, where geophysical data constrain density, velocity, and temperature--pressure con- ditions. Some upper mantle minerals are present in samples of ultrabasic xenoliths in kimber- lites, carbonatites, alkali basalts, and alpine peri- dotites juxtaposed with the crust. Furthermore, phase relations are fairly accessible to experimen- tation. Xenoliths in alkali basalts that originate from the upper mantle at depths of 60--90 km are mainly spinel peridotites (up to 80%), pyroxen- ites, and eclogites. Eclogites are more common in continental settings and along continental mar- gins. Olivine, orthopyroxene (enstatite), clinopy- roxene (chrome--diopside and augite), spinel min- erals, amphiboles, titanium--phlogopite, garnet, plagioclase, and apatite are the main miner- als in these xenoliths. Xenoliths in kimber- lites are from greater depths (130 km and deeper; some xenoliths from pipes in Lesotho are attributed to depths of 250 km). Olivine, orthopyroxene (enstatite--hypersthene), clinopy- roxene (omphacite, diopside), pyrope, chromite, phlogopite, and diamonds are characteristic minerals in kimberlite xenoliths. In diamonds there are microscopic inclusions of olivine, chrome pyrope, chromite, enstatite, diopside, omphacite, rutile, ilmenite, magnetite, corun- dum, pyrrhotite, zircon, sanidine, and phlogo- pite, suggesting that these minerals exist in the upper mantle (Figure 35.3). A.E. Ringwood (1975) suggested that, on the whole, the upper man- tle is composed of pyrolite,w h i c hi sat y p eo f peridotite enriched in aluminum and potassium, as compared with average alpine peridotites that comprise the lithosphere and are occasionally ob- served in the crust. It is thought that the com- position of most peridotites that reach the sur- face have been modi\ufb01ed by extraction of basaltic melt. Pyrolite is thus a combination of three parts alpine peridotite (harzburgite) and one part oceanic basalt (tholeiite). During subduction along continental margins, basalts transform to eclogites at depths of 100--150 km. Most of this upper mantle is solid, and only in the uppermost part is there evidence for par- tial melting, for example in regions of divergence with upwelling along mid-oceanic ridges and in rising diapirs, as well as in subduction zones (Figure 35.4). Nevertheless, the solid mantle be- haves like a viscous liquid and is convecting in large cells driven by temperature gradients. This convection causes signi\ufb01cant lateral and vertical heterogeneity. In fact recent seismological obser- vations indicate that some subducting slabs are Fig. 35.3 Diamond from Kimberlite in Zimbabwe with inclusions of garnet and diopside. The inclusion assemblages suggest that those diamonds equilibrated at 1100\u20131300 \u25e6C and 5\u20136 GPa, i.e., a depth of 180\u2013200 km (courtesy M.G.", "page": 603}

{"text": "590 MINERAL COMPOSITION OF THE EARTH Fig. 35.4 Cross-section through the upper earth with mantle convection, upwelling at mid-oceanic ridge, subduction of oceanic crust under continent and accumulation of sediments in a trench. Also shown are hot spot volcanism, island arc volcanism, and intrusions of batholiths (after Ringwood, 1975). transported to great depths near the core-mantle boundary. When this material heats up, it forms liquid plumes that intrude towards the surface (Figure 35.5). In the transition zone, both the speed of lon- gitudinal seismic waves and the material den- sity increase with depth faster than they do in the upper mantle (see Figure 35.1). This change can be related to polymorphic phase transi- tions. High-pressure experiments show that in this depth--temperature range, olivine (Mg 2SiO4) transforms into wadsleyite and then into a mate- rial with spinel structure ( ringwoodite,M g 2SiO4) (Figure 35.6). The transition occurs at higher pressure for Mg-olivine than for Fe-olivine. Pyroxene transforms into a garnet structure (majorite) according to the reaction 2Mg 2(Si2O6) \u2192 MgVIII3(MgSiVI)(SiO4)3 (superscripts indicate coor- dination). At greater depths, around 660 km, there is again an abrupt increase in velocity (see Figure 35.1). This increase can be attributed to the break- down of spinel (ringwoodite) into a mixture of MgO (periclase,o rmagnesiow \u00a8ustite if some iron is present, with the structure of halite) and MgSiO 3 (with the structure of perovskite) via the reaction Mg 2SiO4 \u2192 MgO + MgSiO3 (Figure 35.6). Water is an important component at depths between 400 and 660 km, comprising about 0.1 weight%, and supposedly contained mainly in Mg-silicates. With increasing pressure mineral transitions go from complicated and relatively open sili- cate structures to simple and highly symmetri- cal close-packed oxide structures. There is a large volume reduction during these reactions, which has been correlated with deep-focus earthquakes. Whereas silicon is always in tetrahedral oxygen coordination at low pressure, it goes into octahe- dral coordination at very high pressure, such as in perovskite (MgSiO 3) and stishovite (SiO 2). The mineralogical composition also becomes simpler with increasing depth (Table 35.3). Above the core mantle boundary, a thin, very heterogeneous layer exists, called D \u2032\u2032, that is de- \ufb01ned by its anomalous seismic properties with very small body-wave velocity gradients. It may contain complex phases, pockets or layers of melt, and highly deformed material (see Fig- ure 35.5) and may be the source of mantle plumes that give rise to hot spots in the crust. Obviously, the interpretation of mineral phases beyond a depth of 600 km is fairly tentative and there is much speculation.

An estimate of the mineralogical composition of the mantle is given in Table 35.4. Composition of the inner core To account for the overall density of the earth, the core has to be composed of heavy elements. Of those, iron and nickel are by far of the great- est cosmic abundance. It is likely that the core has a composition similar to that of iron me- teorites. Transverse seismic waves do not pen- etrate the core, and on this basis it is con- cluded that the outer core is liquid, but the in- ner core is solid. A phase diagram suggests that iron is present in the hexagonal close-packed form (\u03b5) at the high temperatures and pressures in the core (Figure 35.7). Diamond anvil exper- iments have been able to reproduce the high pressures in the center of the earth, but they have not yet simultaneously recreated the high temperatures. Seismic measurements indicate that the den- sity of the core is less than that of pure metal- lic iron. This problem could be solved if the core also contains some lighter elements such as sulfur, silicon, or even hydrogen or helium. In fact hydrogen becomes metallic at core pres- sures, and experiments have shown that iron hy- dride is stable at pressures of more than 60 GPa (>1600 km depth). Hydrogen may have been in- corporated into the core during the high pres- sures of an early earth hydrogen atmosphere. Hydrogen may still be emanating from the liq- uid core as \ufb02uids composed of H, CO and their reaction products H 2O, C, CH 4 and CO2. The wa- ter component lowers the melting temperature of rocks in the mantle and thus initiates igneous activity. In planets and satellites where this \ufb02ow of volatiles has come to a standstill owing to solidi\ufb01cation of the core, igneous activity has ceased.", "page": 606}

Atmosphere and hydrosphere There are also a wide variety of minerals in both the atmosphere and hydrosphere. Some of these are extraterrestrial in origin. For example, there are 1--2 million tonnes of cosmic dust (see Chapter 34) at any given time in the earth\u2019s at- mosphere. However, less exotic terrestrially based minerals are more common in the atmosphere, ice being the predominant mineral. Other terres- trial minerals that are suspended in the atmo- sphere are minute particles of quartz, feldspars, calcite, chlorite, biotite, muscovite, hydromus- covite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, zircon, and apatite. Some minerals in the atmosphere are there because of volcanic eruptions or industrial pollution. The content of atmospheric aerosols varies from place to place and changes in time. Above oceans, a maximum concentration of min- eral particles is observed at altitudes of 3--4 km. Minerals of the hydrosphere correspond closely to those of the atmosphere.

Mineral evolution over earth\u2019s history In Chapter 34 and earlier in this chapter, we have described the present-day mineral composition of the earth, the moon, and the planets. We also presented general models on how the \ufb01rst min- erals may have formed in the solar system and subsequently accreted in planets. Looking closer to home, how have minerals evolved during the history of the earth? Much of the interpretation of the early history of mineral development on earth is based on characteristic isotope data of minerals found in various classes of meteorites, rocks from the moon, and terrestrial rocks. As we have seen, the hot solar nebula initially condensed into protoplanets, their satellites, and asteroids. Below 1500 K, in a turbulently convect- ing hydrogen silicate atmosphere, many minerals precipitate, including olivine, diopside, feldspar, enstatite, and metallic iron (Figure 35.8; see also Figure 34.7). In the differentiating earth, the present structure, with core, mantle and crust, developed during the \ufb01rst 500 million years. Differentiation occurred on the basis of density and melting point. Volatiles such as hydrogen, helium, sodium, potassium, lead, mercury, and zinc, with low melting points, accumulated in the outer parts of the earth and were partially swept away by the solar wind. Iron and other ferrous elements condensed under the force of gravity and started to accrete in the core. At a later stage, high-temperature silicates and oxides crystallized and accreted as a primitive mantle. Earth minerals have been forming for the last 4.7 billion years in various stages, the oldest rocks having been dated at 3.8 billion years. During an early protoplanet stage the list of minerals included about 40--50 species, corre- sponding largely to minerals in the oldest metal- lic meteorites and in primitive chondrites: en- statite, hypersthene, pigeonite, olivine, taenite, kamacite. At the basalt stage , when the mantle was ac- creted and started to cool, minerals typical of basaltic magmas began to form in the earth, as well as on the moon and presumably other plan- ets. The major new mineral species that appeared were feldspars. The mineralogical composition of this early earth\u2019s mantle corresponded closely to rocks of the moon, particularly: r Major minerals ( > 10%): pyroxenes, plagioclase, olivine, ilmenite r Secondary minerals (1--10%): cristobalite, tridymite, pyroxferroite", "page": 608}
{"text": "MICROSCOPIC MINERALOGY 595 At the beginning of the development of the crust there were no more than 200--300 minerals occurring in the earth. Over time, the environment became more complex; iron--nickel concentrated in the core under gravitational differentiation, the core and mantle degassed, and water appeared, \ufb01rst as fresh water and later accumulating in saline oceans. In the early stages there was an oxygen de\ufb01ciency. Only after the formation of an oxygen-rich atmosphere by pho- tosynthesis did new mineral species crystallize, most notably iron oxides and hydroxides of the Early Precambrian banded iron formations, as well as siliceous sediments. Crystallization of feldspars, micas, and quartz would later take place in granitic magmas. Surface minerals as well as diagenetic alterations added chlorites, serpentine, kaolinite, hematite, carbonates, and halides. Two tendencies are observed in this evolution. First, in similar geological conditions the number of minerals increases from older to younger rocks. Second, the chemical compo- sition of minerals and their crystal structures becomes more complex with the evolution of a differentiated crust. Nevertheless, by about the Late Precambrian, most of the minerals that we know of today probably already existed. Some of the important mineral-forming envi- ronments are summarized in Figure 35.4. The in- teraction of the convective mantle and the crust is the source of the major volcanic rocks, either during upwelling at ridges producing basalts, or during subduction with the formation of island arcs and remelting of andesitic material. Volcan- ism also occurs at hot spots. In the USA, al- kali basalts in Hawaii and Yellowstone National Park are oceanic and continental examples, re- spectively. Plate divergence on continents often produces complex igneous activities, generally with alkaline rocks such as syenites and carbon- atites, as in the Kola Peninsula (Russia), the Rhine Graben (Germany), and the East African Rift. Mantle convection is also the driving force for tectonic activity and associated metamorphism: convergence of plates may produce subduction that results in high-pressure metamorphic rocks such as blueschists (containing glaucophane, jadeite, and aragonite) and ultimately eclogites (with omphacite and pyrope). Where granites intrude into country rock, contact metamor- phism produces skarns and hydrothermal activ- ity with typical minerals, garnet, vesuvianite, and epidote. During crustal shortening, overthrust- ing with regional metamorphism causes amphi- bolites, gneisses, and marbles to form. Topographic elevation changes and the in- \ufb02uence of water and ice cause original min- erals to erode and dissolve; ultimately, they are transported to more stable settings. These dissolved and retransported minerals form the basis of sedimentary minerals such as clays, cristobalite--quartz, and calcite, which crystallize in lakes and oceans and are often associated with organisms. In humid tropical environments, supergene alteration of silicate rocks may oc- cur and transform them to hydroxides (baux- ite, goethite--limonite, manganese minerals) and clays (kaolinite).

Now, with new instrumental techniques, we are able to gain a wealth of information about these smallest crystals. Such microscopic material calls into question the de\ufb01nition of a mineral. By now, it should be clear that our de\ufb01nition of a mineral as a structurally and chemically homogeneous and naturally occurring inorganic material, as intro- duced in Chapter 1, is highly idealistic, if not outright arbitrary. This was alluded to by Fritz Laves 40 years ago when he reviewed the status of mineralogy on the occasion of the \ufb01ftieth", "page": 609}
{"text": "596 MINERAL COMPOSITION OF THE EARTH Box 35.1 What is a mineral? What is a crystal? (F . Laves, 1962) The writer, as a professor of mineralogy, has frequently been asked \u201cWhat is mineralogy?\u201d An answer like \u201cit is the science which deals with minerals\u201d can easily be given; some people, however, are not content with such an answer and want to know \u201cWhat are minerals?\u201d At this point it is better to leave the room, for there is no satisfactory answer to such a question. Looking into textbooks of mineralogy one \ufb01nds that a mineral is an inorganic substance produced by natural processes. Furthermore \u2019\u2018homogeneity\u201d is one of the properties that belongs to a mineral. However, what does \u201chomogeneous\u201d mean? This question could not be answered in a satisfactory way before 1912, nor can it be answered today. Laue\u2019s discovery has not helped us to answer this basic question of mineralogy. However, in many special cases X-rays can tell us that substances previously thought to be homogeneous are actually mixtures of different substances; in other cases X-rays have revealed structural features in \u201cminerals\u201d which are fascinating and which add considerably to the liveliness of the present day research in structural mineralogy. Much of Laves\u2019 conclusion, presented in 1962, still holds, even after nearly half a century of new methods in mineralogy such as electron microscopy, microanalysis, and many spectroscopic techniques. Research in mineralogy answers some ques- tions but also opens a whole range of new ones, which makes it a very dynamic branch of science. The classical de\ufb01nition of minerals as natural, inorganic, and ho- mogeneous compounds with names and chemical formulas is increasingly blurred and of peripheral interest. T oday, the concepts of genesis, heterogeneity, defects, and biological in\ufb02uences are in the center of modern mineralogical research, as foreseen by Laves. anniversary of the discovery of X-ray diffraction (Box 35.1). There are numerous examples of minerals where seemingly homogeneous macroscopic crys- tals are composed of \ufb01ne lamellae with different compositions and ordering states. Even in chem- ically homogeneous crystals, the periodic lattice structure is interrupted by dislocations. It is also interesting to note that among the new miner- als discovered during the past 20 years, a great number of them are microscopic and have been found only in crystals of dimension less than 0 . 1m m .( F o re x a m p l e ,o ft h e5 3n e wm i n e r a l s discovered in 1998, 13 are microscopic.) However, one does not need to look at rare new minerals to \ufb01nd small crystals: most clay minerals occur as aggregates with crystals less than 0.01 mm in size. Devitri\ufb01ed glass is composed of very small particles. Ores formed by weathering -- for ex- ample, iron, aluminum, and manganese hydrox- ides in laterites -- are, as a rule, cryptocrystalline. Outside the earth environment, minerals found in samples of the lunar regolith, the surface of Mars, chondritic meteorites, and cosmic dust are", "page": 610}
{"text": "generally very \ufb01ne grained, and electron micro- scopes are needed for their study. Every natural mineral begins to grow as a nucleus, but then it generally advances to a macroscopic crystal to reduce the surface energy relative to the internal free energy of a stable crystal. It is thus reasonable to ask why many clay minerals never grow to a respectable size. All of them have a layered crystal structure with extreme heterogeneity in stacking and a lack of long-range order. They are composed internally of small units in which charges are locally bal- anced, so that the driving force for joining units to larger crystals is small compared, for example, with a crystal of sodium chloride containing many unbalanced ionic bonds on its surface. The main reason that minerals remain \ufb01ne grained is that chemical reactions stop and an", "page": 610}

This termina- tion of chemical reactivity can be due to struc- tural causes, as in the clays discussed above, or simply to kinetic reasons, particularly at low temperatures, as in heterogeneous carbonates in limestone. On the other hand, reactivity may increase be- cause of the small grain size and unusual reac- tions may take place because of the high surface energy. The grain size of quartz crystals has been found to have an in\ufb02uence on the temperature of polymorphic transformations. Small particles of pyrite are more enriched in gold and silver than larger crystals of the same mineral. Overall, mi- croscopically dispersed ore is often richer in min- erals of widely diverse and sometimes unusual composition as compared with simpler mineral compositions of the same coarse-grained ores. In this respect the intergranular substance (i.e., the material between grains and concentrated on grain boundaries as a thin \ufb01lm) becomes signi\ufb01cant. Petrov et al. (1993) used electron microscopy to investigate the composition of the intergranu- lar substance in a xenolith of spinel peridotite in basalt. The intergranular phase in this sample, lo- cated on grain boundaries and in some cavities, is 10--100 /H9262m thick and comprises 1--2% of the total mass of the xenolith. The investigators found the intergranular phase exists only on grain bound- aries between different minerals and varies lo- cally in composition; on average, it is enriched in aluminum, alkali, and alkali earth elements, which are less compatible with the main min- erals in the rock (Figure 35.9). The investigators conclude that the intergranular phase represents the residue after crystallization of the main rock- forming components; and that the unusual com- position also contains information about crystal- lization mechanisms. Because of the surface energy and the com- position of the intergranular phase that must exist in metamorphic rocks in order for reac- tions to occur, very \ufb01ne-grained materials have different reactivity. Locally, they also often have different thermodynamic properties. Surface re- actions (e.g., ionic adsorption in clays and zeo- lites) are \ufb01elds of current intense investigation in mineralogy.

{"text": "598 MINERAL COMPOSITION OF THE EARTH also has an effect on mechanical properties. As was discussed in Chapter 13, large crystals de- form primarily by dislocation glide and climb. For reduced grain size, surface diffusion becomes signi\ufb01cant, and small particles may start to ro- tate independently, as with marbles, through a mechanism known as superplasticity where ma- terial can become very ductile. Grain size reduc- tion takes place in heavily deformed mylonites through mechanical abrasion (cataclasis) and dy- namic recrystallization (subgrain formation). Nanocrystals are typically found in another class of minerals: biominerals. These minerals, which include apatite in bones, aragonite and calcite in mollusk shells, as well as minerals asso- ciated with bacteria (Ban\ufb01eld and Nealson, 1997), including minute magnetite crystals, are all ex- tremely \ufb01ne grained. It is this diversity of lo- cal structures, local defects, and surface struc- tures that make minerals very relevant today for a wide range of sciences and has spawned much mineralogical research in areas unimagined sev- eral decades ago.
